# DEREK RESPONSE - HYBRID DEFENSE & REBUILD PLAN

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Re:** CATY SELL Thesis - Response to Critique
**From:** Nirvan Chitnis
**To:** Derek (Equity Research Review)

---

## Executive Summary

**What I'm defending:** The core economic insight that CATY's current credit performance (18 bps LTM NCO) is unsustainably low relative to banking sector through-cycle norms, and provision normalization drives material ROTE compression.

**What I'm conceding:** The supporting evidence architecture has critical gaps—peer sample too small (n=4), COE methodology circular, credit model backward-looking, capital stress untested.

**What I'm committing to:** Deliver 5 structural rebuilds within 10 business days to convert this from a pitch deck into an institutional-grade short case.

**Bottom line:** The -12% downside is directionally correct but needs bulletproof evidence. I'm not retracting the SELL; I'm upgrading the rigor.

---

## I. DEFENDING THE CORE THESIS

### A. Through-Cycle NCO Normalization Is NOT "Lazy Math"

**Your critique:**
> "Your entire SELL call leans on a single historical average (42.8 bps) without proving why CATY's forward loss content deserves Great Financial Crisis weighting."

**My defense:**

1. **Banking-sector convention:** Every major bank analyst (JPM, GS, BAC coverage) uses through-cycle loss rates for stress testing and normalized earnings power. This is not novel—it's **standard practice** for valuing cyclical financials.

2. **17-year window is NOT GFC-weighted cherry-picking:**
   - Period: 2008-2024 (includes GFC, COVID, current cycle)
   - CATY's actual 17-year average: **42.8 bps**
   - If we exclude GFC (2009-2010), average drops to **~28 bps** (still 55% above current 18 bps)
   - Even a non-GFC normalized rate compresses ROTE materially

3. **Forward-looking validation:**
   - CATY CRE concentration: **52.4%** (vs. peer median 40%) ✓ SOURCED
   - Office exposure within CRE: **% TBD - not disclosed in Q2'25 10-Q** (pending IR data or regulatory filings)
   - Historical correlation: High CRE banks experience 2.0-2.5x peer NCO rates during downturns (needs citation)
   - Thesis: CATY's mix + cycle position → mean reversion inevitable

**What I owe you:**
- **Loan-level cohort analysis** segmented by vintage, collateral type, LTV, DSCR (from Q2'25 10-Q)
- **Scenario-weighted NCOs** (Base 42.8 bps, Bull 25 bps, Bear 60 bps) tied to macro drivers (GDP, unemployment, cap rates)
- **Migration analysis** showing current 18 bps vs. 30/60/90 delinquency trends

**Delivery:** 7 business days

### B. The Economic Logic Is Sound (Even If Evidence Is Thin)

**The chain of reasoning:**

1. **CATY's LTM ROTE (11.95%) is elevated** because provision expense is too low (18 bps NCO vs. historical 42.8 bps)
2. **Normalizing provisions** to through-cycle rates compresses ROTE to **10.40%** (calculated, not guessed)
3. **Lower normalized ROTE → lower justified P/TBV** via Gordon Growth rearrangement: P/TBV = (ROTE - g) / (COE - g)
4. **Market hasn't repriced** CATY from current 1.269x P/TBV to normalized 1.115x → **-12% downside**

**Your pushback:**
> "This doesn't compute because TBVPS growth at 6.5%-9.5% (2015-2024) is waved away with a 'buyback' shrug."

**My response:**
- Historical TBVPS CAGR includes **capital deployment volatility** (buybacks ranged from $0 to $250M annually)
- For perpetuity valuation, terminal growth must reflect **sustainable organic earnings retention**, not episodic buybacks
- g=2.5% is **conservative by design** (matches long-term GDP, below CATY's 3.2% deposit CAGR)
- Concession: I will **decompose TBVPS growth** into (1) retained earnings, (2) buyback impact, (3) AOCI moves and justify terminal g bottom-up

**Delivery:** 5 business days

## II. CONCEDING THE STATISTICAL WEAKNESSES

### A. n=4 Regression Is Indefensible

**I agree.** R²=0.95 on 4 data points is not evidence—it's overfitting. A high school AP Stats student could torch this.

**What I'm committing to:**

1. **Expand peer universe to n=10-15** using transparent screening:
   - Market cap $2-15B (regional bank bracket)
   - CRE exposure >30% (similar risk profile)
   - Geographic overlap (West Coast + diversified)
   - Exclude: mega-regionals (>$50B assets), specialty lenders, distressed names

2. **Full regression diagnostics:**
   - Residual plots, Cook's Distance, DFBETAS, VIF
   - Leave-one-out cross-validation
   - Alternative functional forms (log-linear, quadratic ROTE term)
   - Out-of-sample test using 2023 data to predict 2024 multiples

3. **Compare P/TBV regression to alternative frameworks:**
   - Residual income model (RI = NI - COE × TCE)
   - Dividend discount model (if applicable)
   - Trading comps (median/quartile analysis vs. regression)

**Delivery:** 10 business days

---

### B. Circular COE Is a Real Problem

**Your critique:**
> "Implied COE math: reverse engineering from the same cherry-picked peer set that feeds the valuation loop is circular."

**100% correct.** I used the peer regression intercept/slope to back out implied COE, then used that COE to normalize CATY's valuation. That's circular logic.

**What I'm committing to:**

1. **CAPM COE from scratch:**
   - Pull CATY 5-year weekly returns (Bloomberg/Yahoo Finance)
   - Regress vs. S&P 500 to get β
   - COE = Risk-free rate (10Y Treasury 4.5%) + β × Equity risk premium (5-6%)
   - Cross-check: Does CAPM COE ≈ 9.6% implied COE? If not, reconcile the gap

2. **Multi-factor model (Fama-French 3-factor):**
   - Add size (SMB) and value (HML) factors for regional bank beta
   - Compare 1-factor CAPM vs. 3-factor COE
   - Sensitivity: How does valuation change if COE is 8% vs. 11%?

3. **Rebuild valuation tables with dual-sourced COE:**
   - Scenario 1: CAPM COE (exogenous)
   - Scenario 2: Implied COE (peer-based)
   - Show delta between the two approaches

**Delivery:** 7 business days

## V. ADDRESSING YOUR CROSS-EXAMINATION (10 QUESTIONS)

**1. Prove CATY's loan book today mirrors 2008-2010 mix that produced 300 bps losses.**

**Response:** I cannot prove a 1:1 match, and I'm not claiming that. The thesis is:
- 2008-2010 CRE concentration was ~48% (FDIC data); today it's **52.4%** (higher risk)
- GFC peak NCO (305.9 bps) was driven by construction/land loans; today's office exposure is the analogous tail risk
- I will segment current loan mix by collateral type and compare to 2008-2010 vintage to quantify overlap
- **Deliverable:** Loan cohort comparison table (Oct 28)

**2. Show me quarterly reserve build vs. NCOs over last 8 quarters; how much cushion is embedded?**

**Response:** This is a **critical data point** I missed. Will extract from 10-Q:
- ALLL balance (beginning/ending each quarter)
- Provision expense vs. net charge-offs (build/release)
- ACL coverage ratio (ALLL / Total Loans)
- **Deliverable:** 8-quarter bridge table (Oct 26)

**3. Exact regression spec, residual plots, out-of-sample test; leave-one-out analysis?**

**Response:** Current n=4 regression cannot support this. Will rebuild with n=10-15 and deliver:
- Full regression equation with standard errors
- Residual vs. fitted plot (homoskedasticity check)
- QQ plot (normality of residuals)
- Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV RMSE)
- **Deliverable:** Statistical appendix (Nov 1)

**4. Quantify TBVPS CAGR decomposition: buyback-driven vs. core earnings retention.**

**Response:** I estimated this mentally but didn't show the math. Will build:
- Annual bridge: Beginning TBVPS + EPS × Retention - Buyback Impact + AOCI = Ending TBVPS
- Isolate organic growth (retained earnings only) vs. capital actions
- Justify terminal g=2.5% using decomposition
- **Deliverable:** TBVPS decomposition table 2015-2024 (Oct 27)

**5. What beta do you get if you run CAPM on CATY (5-year weekly)? Why doesn't that anchor COE?**

**Response:** I don't know yet—this is the circular COE problem you nailed. Will:
- Pull 5-year weekly CATY returns vs. S&P 500
- Calculate β via OLS regression (Excel or Python)
- Compute CAPM COE = Rf + β × ERP
- If CAPM COE ≠ implied 9.6%, reconcile the gap (peer quality, leverage, size premium)
- **Deliverable:** CAPM COE memo (Oct 29)

**6. Map management guidance on credit costs from Q2'25 call; how are you refuting it?**

**Response:** Management guided "normalized" credit costs of 25-30 bps (if I recall). My refutation:
- Management has incentive bias (smoothing expectations)
- CRE cycle lags—losses show up 12-24 months after origination stress
- I will quote their guidance verbatim, then provide counter-evidence (loan migration trends, peer NCO rates)
- **Deliverable:** Management guidance rebuttal memo (Oct 28)

**7. Demonstrate sensitivity of Monte Carlo to correlation between NCO and COE.**

**Response:** Current Monte Carlo assumes **independent sampling** (ρ=0), which is wrong. During stress:
- NCOs spike (credit losses)
- Equity volatility increases (COE rises)
- Growth slows (g falls)
- Will rebuild Monte Carlo with correlation matrix:
  - ρ(NCO, COE) = 0.3 to 0.7 (positive correlation in stress)
  - ρ(NCO, g) = -0.5 (negative correlation)
  - Show how correlated shocks change 69% overvaluation probability
- **Deliverable:** Correlated Monte Carlo sensitivity (Nov 1)

**8. Provide secondary market data on CATY CRE exposures (cap rates, occupancy).**

**Response:** This requires third-party data (Trepp, MSCI, CoStar). I don't have direct access, but will:
- Extract management commentary from 10-Q MD&A on CRE performance
- Use proxy data (regional office cap rate trends, vacancy rates from CoStar if available)
- Apply 20% severity assumption to office portfolio and stress-test Bear case
- **Deliverable:** CRE market data memo (Oct 30)

**9. Detail deposit mix trends (core vs. time vs. brokered) Q1'22→Q2'25; inform future betas?**

**Response:** Critical for deposit beta credibility. Will extract quarterly:
- DDA, MMDA, Savings, Time Deposits, Brokered ($ and %)
- Cost by category (quarterly average rates)
- Show how mix shift (e.g., time deposit growth) drives beta path
- Forward beta forecast: If mix normalizes, beta falls to 45-50% (vs. 60.4% up-cycle)
- **Deliverable:** Deposit mix & beta analysis (Oct 29)

**10. Stress-test TBVPS using AOCI volatility; unrealized loss bucket at current rates?**

**Response:** Q2'25 AOCI was **-$60M** (from 10-Q). Will:
- Model TBVPS sensitivity to +/- 100 bps rate shock
- Show how AFS/HTM portfolio duration drives AOCI swing
- If rates fall 100 bps, AOCI improves ~$40M → TBVPS +$0.60
- If rates rise 100 bps, AOCI worsens ~$50M → TBVPS -$0.75
- **Deliverable:** AOCI stress table (Oct 27)

**11. Implied upside case if CATY deploys excess capital into accretive MBS instead of buybacks?**

**Response:** This is a **bull case challenge** I didn't model. Will scenario:
- Current CET1: 13.35% (150 bps above 11.5% target)
- Excess capital: ~$150M available
- Option A: Buyback at 1.27x P/TBV (current)
- Option B: Deploy into MBS yielding 5.5% (vs. 3.3% loan yield)
- Show ROE impact and P/TBV re-rating if NIM expands
- **Deliverable:** Capital deployment upside case (Oct 30)

**12. How does management's hedging program change your NIM trajectory?**

**Response:** I don't know if CATY hedges aggressively (need to read 10-Q/10-K disclosures). Will:
- Extract derivative footnote from Q2'25 10-Q
- Quantify notional amount of swaps/caps (if any)
- Adjust NIM forecast if hedges cap deposit cost upside
- If no hedging disclosed, this supports my deposit beta risk thesis
- **Deliverable:** Hedging analysis memo (Oct 28)

---

## VI. WHAT I'M NOT CHANGING (THESIS ANCHORS)

**These core beliefs are defensible and I'm standing by them:**

1. **CATY's current credit performance is unsustainably low.**
   LTM NCO of 18 bps is bottom-decile for regional banks with 52% CRE exposure. Mean reversion is not a question of "if," but "when" and "how much."

2. **Provision normalization is the right framework for bank valuation.**
   Every institutional bank analyst normalizes earnings power through the cycle. This is not a bug—it's how you separate structural performance from cyclical noise.

3. **P/TBV regression is the appropriate valuation methodology for banks.**
   DCF is messy for financials (leverage, regulatory capital, credit cycle timing). P/TBV vs. ROTE regression is industry-standard. My execution was flawed (n=4), but the framework is sound.

4. **CATY is overvalued at 1.269x P/TBV given normalized ROTE of 10.40%.**
   Even if my peer regression changes with n=10, the economic logic holds: lower ROTE → lower justified multiple. The magnitude may shift, but the direction is locked.

5. **-12% downside is a reasonable starting point for debate.**
   I'm not claiming this is a "high-conviction short" (yet). It's a SELL rating with material downside if the market reprices credit normalization. If I rebuild the evidence and downside shrinks to -8%, I'll update the target. If it expands to -18%, I'll upgrade to STRONG SELL.

## VIII. WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE (POST-REBUILD)

**If I execute all 5 non-negotiables and answer your 12 questions, this is what the upgraded CATY research package will contain:**

1. **Institutional-grade credit model**
   - Loan cohort analysis by vintage, collateral, LTV, DSCR
   - 3-scenario NCO framework (Bull 25 bps, Base 42.8 bps, Bear 60 bps)
   - Macro sensitivity (GDP, unemployment, CRE cap rates → NCO path)
   - Management guidance rebuttal with evidence

2. **Statistically defensible valuation**
   - n=10-15 peer regression with full diagnostics (R², residuals, LOOCV)
   - CAPM COE (exogenous) vs. implied COE (peer-based) reconciliation
   - Alternative frameworks (residual income, trading comps) for triangulation
   - Sensitivity tables showing valuation range under different COE/g assumptions

3. **Capital stress analysis**
   - CET1 bridge under Base/Bear scenarios (credit losses → capital depletion)
   - ACL coverage ratio adequacy (current 1.2% vs. stress-case requirements)
   - TBVPS impact including AOCI volatility
   - Payout capacity (dividends, buybacks) under stress

4. **CRE exposure deep dive**
   - Loan-level detail from 10-Q (office, retail, multifamily, construction)
   - Third-party market data (cap rates, vacancy, NOI trends) for severity validation
   - Comparison to peer CRE concentrations and loss histories
   - Tail risk scenarios (20% office loss, 10% multifamily loss) with capital impact

5. **Deposit beta & NIM forecast**
   - Historical deposit mix trends (Q1'22 → Q2'25)
   - Account-level repricing analysis (DDA, MMDA, Time)
   - Forward beta forecast under rate cut scenario (Fed funds 4.5% → 3.5%)
   - Hedging program impact (if disclosed)

**Outcome:** A 50-page institutional equity research report that can withstand forensic-level scrutiny from portfolio managers, risk officers, and analysts like you.

## IX. FINAL WORD

**Derek, you're right that the current work product is "presentation, not conviction."**

The core economic insight is sound: CATY is overvalued because the market hasn't priced in credit normalization. But the supporting evidence is half-baked—small peer sample, circular COE, backward-looking credit model, no capital stress.

**I'm not retracting the SELL thesis. I'm committing to build the evidence fortress it deserves.**

Give me 10 business days. If I can't deliver the 5 non-negotiables with the rigor you've outlined, I'll downgrade to HOLD and concede the thesis is unprovable.

But if I execute—if the expanded peer regression holds, if CAPM COE validates the implied COE, if the cycle-adjusted credit model shows 40+ bps normalized NCO, if the capital stress proves Bear-case solvency risk—then the SELL rating stands, and the target may even move lower.

**This is not capitulation. This is upgrading from a pitch to a publishable short case.**

Let's reconvene November 1st with the full rebuild.
