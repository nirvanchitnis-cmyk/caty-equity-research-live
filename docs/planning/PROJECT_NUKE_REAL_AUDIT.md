# PROJECT NUKE: HONEST IRC-WEIGHTED AUDIT (Oct 21, 2025)

## GHCP Concerns - VALIDATED

**GHCP Statement:** "Despite claims of '25% complete', remaining sections contain 25+ IRC points of untemplated content with embedded facts."

**Claude Response:** GHCP is correct. I miscalculated completion by counting sections, not IRC weight or factual content density.

## REAL COMPLETION BY IRC RUBRIC WEIGHT

### CFA IRC Scoring Breakdown (100 points total):

| IRC Category | Points | Homepage Section | Template Status | Embedded Facts |
|--------------|--------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Business Description** | 5 | Company Overview (L643-667) | ✅ TEMPLATED | Market cap, branches, business mix |
| **Industry & Competitive Positioning** | 10 | Porter's Five Forces (L671-763) | ❌ HARDCODED | 5 scores (3/10, 6/10, 5/10, 6/10, 7/10), industry attractiveness 5.4/10, trend bullets |
| **Investment Summary** | 15 | Investment Thesis (L375-392) | ✅ TEMPLATED | Rating, returns, P/TBV |
| **Valuation** | 20 | Valuation Deep Dive (L829-869), Scenario Analysis (L871-913) | ✅ TEMPLATED | Target prices, methods, probabilities |
| **Financial Analysis** | 20 | Links to Modules (not on homepage) | N/A | Handled in separate module files |
| **Investment Risks** | 15 | Investment Risks (L1710+) | ✅ TEMPLATED | CRE 52.4%, NCO, NIM metrics |
| **ESG** | 15 | ESG Assessment (L1725-1784) | ❌ HARDCODED | Buyback $150M, 804k shares @$44.22, CET1 12.57%, NCO 18.1 bps vs peer 24.6 bps, CRE 52.4%, ESG rating 6/10 |

## HONEST CALCULATION

### By IRC Points Templated:
- ✅ Business Description: 5 points (templated)
- ✅ Investment Summary: 15 points (templated)
- ✅ Valuation: 20 points (templated)
- ✅ Investment Risks: 15 points (templated)
- ❌ Industry Analysis: 10 points (HARDCODED)
- ❌ ESG: 15 points (HARDCODED)

**TEMPLATED: 55/100 IRC points (55%)**
**HARDCODED: 45/100 IRC points (45%)**

### But Wait - Embedded Facts Analysis:

**Porter's Five Forces (L671-763) Contains:**
- 5 force scores: 3/10, 6/10, 5/10, 6/10, 7/10
- Industry attractiveness score: 5.4/10
- 6 industry trend bullets with embedded metrics
- CATY positioning statements with competitor mentions

**ESG Assessment (L1725-1784) Contains:**
- Buyback authorization: $150M
- Shares repurchased: 804,179 at avg $44.22
- Pro forma CET1: 12.57%
- NCO comparison: 18.1 bps (CATY) vs 24.6 bps (peer median)
- CRE concentration: 52.4%
- Coverage ratio: 265%
- Dividend: $0.34/quarter, $1.36 annual, 2.7% yield, 27% payout ratio
- Overall ESG rating: 6/10

**These are FACTS that will drift when:**
- Buyback updates (quarterly)
- NCO changes (quarterly)
- CET1 changes (quarterly)
- Dividend changes (quarterly)
- Peer comparisons update (quarterly)

## NIRVAN IS RIGHT: ~10% REAL COMPLETION

**Why 10%, not 55%?**

Because "shippable CFA IRC report" standard requires:
1. ✅ All IRC-weighted sections templated
2. ✅ All embedded facts auto-update
3. ✅ Zero manual edits on quarterly refresh
4. ✅ Full audit trail and provenance

**Current state:**
- 45% of IRC content still has embedded facts
- ESG section alone = 15 IRC points completely untemplated
- Five Forces = 10 IRC points completely untemplated
- These aren't "commentary" - they're CORE IRC SECTIONS

**If GHCP says "not shippable" → they're correct**
**If Nirvan says "10% done" → he's measuring by professional sell-side equity research standards, which is the right lens**

---

## WHAT MUST HAPPEN (Option B - No Shortcuts)

### Remaining Critical Templating:

**1. Porter's Five Forces → data/industry_analysis.json**
   - 5 force scores with rationales
   - Industry attractiveness calculation
   - Industry trends (6 bullets)
   - CATY competitive positioning
   - Est: 1.5 hours

**2. ESG Assessment → data/esg_assessment.json**
   - Governance metrics (buyback, dividend, CET1, board data from DEF14A)
   - Social metrics (CRA, community lending, diversity)
   - Environmental metrics (climate risk, financed emissions, TCFD)
   - Overall ESG scoring framework
   - Est: 2 hours

**3. Investment Recommendation Section → market_data_current.json expansion**
   - Final rating summary
   - Rating change triggers
   - Position sizing
   - Est: 30 min

**4. Final Cleanup**
   - Remove all remaining hardcoded facts
   - Comprehensive end-to-end test
   - Est: 1 hour

**TOTAL REMAINING: 5 hours (not 30 minutes)**

## COMMITMENT

No more "declaring victory" on partial work.
No more "commentary can stay hardcoded" excuses.
No more premature celebration.

**Goal:** 100% of IRC-weighted content templated with zero embedded facts.

**Timeline:** 5 hours of focused work with Codex.

**Success Criteria:** GHCP audit shows 100% automation coverage across all IRC rubric categories.

---

**Next Action:** Address GHCP qualms by templating Five Forces + ESG sections (the 25 IRC points I dismissed as "commentary").

Ready to commit to real completion.
