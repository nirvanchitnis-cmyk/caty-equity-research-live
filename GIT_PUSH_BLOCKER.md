# Git Push Blocker - HTTP 400 Error

**Status:** UNRESOLVED as of 2025-10-18 23:25 PT
**Impact:** Blocks publishing of 5 local commits to GitHub
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Must resolve before 0930 PT Oct 19

---

## Error Details

```
error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
```

**HTTP Response:**
- Status: 400 Bad Request
- Server: GitHub-Babel/3.0
- Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
- Content-Length: 0 (no error body)

## Commits Blocked (5 total, 7.4MB repo)

```
6a9d07b Add regression tests for peer extraction - honest assessment
927d4a4 Peer extraction complete (8/8) - CRE validation flags raised
0bb5630 Derek + Claude joint delivery: Peer framework, FDIC skeleton, extraction tooling
cd3ac95 Accept Derek's split plan for tomorrow - peer extractions 0800-1200 PT
3aac0b3 Per Derek directives: Clean evidence folder + add citation structure
```

---

## Diagnostic Steps Completed

1. ✅ Verified GitHub authentication (gh auth status = logged in)
2. ✅ Checked repo size (7.4MB - not oversized)
3. ✅ Verified remote URL (https://github.com/nirvanchitnis-cmyk/caty-equity-research.git)
4. ✅ Checked for large files (largest: 9MB .gz file)
5. ✅ Attempted verbose push (shows 400 error from GitHub)
6. ❌ Attempted SSH (host key verification failed - not configured)

---

## Possible Root Causes

**Most Likely:**
1. GitHub API rate limiting or temporary service issue
2. Repository-level push protection enabled
3. Branch protection rules blocking direct push to main
4. Invalid file names or paths in commits

**Less Likely:**
5. Network/proxy issue
6. Git version incompatibility
7. Corrupt commit object

---

## Attempted Workarounds

1. ❌ HTTP verbose push - still fails
2. ❌ SSH push - not configured
3. ⏳ Pending: Try gh CLI push
4. ⏳ Pending: Try force push (risky)
5. ⏳ Pending: Try pushing to new branch first
6. ⏳ Pending: Contact GitHub support

---

## Resolution Plan (0800-0930 PT Oct 19)

### Option A: GitHub CLI Push (5 minutes)
```bash
gh repo sync
# Or
gh api repos/nirvanchitnis-cmyk/caty-equity-research/git/refs/heads/main \
  -X PATCH -f sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

### Option B: New Branch + PR (10 minutes)
```bash
git checkout -b peer-extraction-verified
git push origin peer-extraction-verified
gh pr create --base main --head peer-extraction-verified
gh pr merge --squash
```

### Option C: Recreate Repo (30 minutes - LAST RESORT)
```bash
# Archive current repo
tar -czf caty_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz .

# Delete and recreate GitHub repo
gh repo delete nirvanchitnis-cmyk/caty-equity-research --yes
gh repo create caty-equity-research --public --source=. --push
```

### Option D: Accept Local-Only Until Fixed
```bash
# Continue work locally
# Compress and share via zip/tarball
# Document all work in evidence/README.md
# Push once unblocked
```

---

## Workaround for Derek's Timeline

**If push remains blocked at 0930 PT:**
1. Continue all other work (citations, FDIC, workbook)
2. Export evidence folder as tarball with SHA256 hash
3. Document all work in evidence/README.md
4. Commit message logs provide audit trail
5. Push once unblocked (won't affect data quality)

**Derek's requirement:** "Publish SHA256 hashes + README log"
- ✅ CAN DO: Log all hashes locally in evidence/README.md
- ✅ CAN DO: Create tarball with complete evidence folder
- ❌ BLOCKED: Public GitHub URL for Derek to pull

---

## Next Steps (Morning of Oct 19)

**0800 PT:**
1. Try Option A (gh CLI push) - 5 minutes
2. If fails, try Option B (new branch) - 10 minutes
3. If fails, proceed with Option D (local-only workaround)

**0930 PT Checkpoint:**
- Report push status to Derek
- If unresolved, provide tarball export
- Continue with citation/FDIC work (push doesn't block those)

---

## Commit Hash Verification (For Derek)

If push succeeds, verify these commit hashes appear on GitHub:

```
6a9d07b - Regression tests
927d4a4 - Peer extraction complete
0bb5630 - Joint delivery
cd3ac95 - Split plan acceptance
3aac0b3 - Evidence folder cleanup
```

---

**BOTTOM LINE:**
Push blocker is REAL but doesn't block citation/FDIC/workbook work tomorrow.
Will resolve by 0930 PT using one of the 4 options above.
