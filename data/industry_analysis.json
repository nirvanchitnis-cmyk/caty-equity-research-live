Post-2008 financial crisis regulations (Dodd-Frank, Basel III) raised compliance costs, effectively barring new entrants. Digital-only banks (e.g., SoFi, Chime) compete in consumer banking but lack commercial banking expertise.",

High barriers to entry and regulatory moats protect incumbents, but intense competition, substitute products, and elevated customer bargaining power limit profitability. For CATY, competitive positioning within a specialized niche (Asian-American banking, cross-border trade) provides better-than-industry returns (ROE 14.7% vs regional bank median ~11-12%)."
