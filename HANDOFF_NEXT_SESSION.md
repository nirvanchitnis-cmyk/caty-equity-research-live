# Quick Start for Next Session

## System Status: FUNCTIONAL ✅

**Quick Test:**
```bash
cd /Users/nirvanchitnis/Desktop/CATY_Clean
python3 scripts/tests/test_covid_crash.py
```

Should show: `✅ COVID crash test PASSED`

**If test passes → system working correctly.**

## What Was Fixed (Oct 20-21):
1. Valuation calculations now recalculate when price changes
2. All IRC content templated (100/100 points)
3. Zero stale timestamps
4. COVID test passes

## Safe to Continue Tomorrow

System is stable. No urgent issues.

Good night!
