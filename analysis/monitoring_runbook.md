## Post-Earnings Execution

**Timing:** October 21, 2025 (after market close)

**CRITICAL NOTE:** FDIC Q3 data will NOT be available until late November (~55 days after Sept 30). Use 10-Q reported NCO initially.

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Download Q3 2025 10-Q from SEC EDGAR
- Extract Q3 NCO rate from financials
- Note any CRE-related disclosures
- Capture management commentary on credit

### Step 2: FDIC Data Update
- Wait for FDIC Q3 2025 call report (typically 30-45 days after quarter-end)
- Expected availability: Mid-November 2025
- Download updated NTLNLSCOQR field
- Append to evidence/raw/fdic_CATY_NTLNLSCOQR_timeseries.csv

### Step 3: Probability Recalculation
**Script:** `python3 analysis/nco_probability_analysis.py`

**Actions:**
1. Update script with Q3 data point
2. Rerun Wilson 95% confidence intervals
3. Calculate new breach probabilities:
   - Post-2014 rate
   - Post-2008 rate
4. Update upper bound (currently 26%)

### Step 4: Valuation Refresh
**Script:** `python3 analysis/probability_weighted_valuation.py`

**Actions:**
1. Input new Wilson upper bound
2. Recalculate expected returns:
   - Data-anchored (85/15 or updated)
   - Wilson 95% upper (74/26 or updated)
3. Compare to +15% BUY threshold

### Step 5: Rating Decision
**Policy:** analysis/rating_policy.md

**Decision Tree:**
- If Wilson upper bound < 21.5% tail: **Entire band > +15% → UPGRADE TO BUY**
- If Wilson upper bound 21.5-35% tail: **HOLD (current)**
- If Wilson upper bound > 35% tail: **Consider SELL**

**Auto-Flip Trigger:**
```
IF (1 - wilson_upper_bound) × target_current + wilson_upper_bound × target_normalized > current_price × 1.15
THEN rating = BUY
```

### Step 6: Documentation
1. Update evidence/probability_dashboard.md with new numbers
2. Add SHA256 hash to evidence/README.md
3. Update DEREK_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md if rating changes
4. Update index.html rating badge if needed
5. Git commit with timestamp
6. Push to GitHub

### Step 7: Notification
**If rating changes:**
- Update site immediately
- Document in commit message
- Notify Derek review desk

**If rating unchanged:**
- Update dashboard only
- Log in evidence/README.md

## Kill-Switches (Immediate Action)

**If Q3 shows:**
- NCO >35 bps: Run emergency stress test, consider SELL
- CET1 <10.5%: Review capital adequacy, adjust tail weight
- Classified loans spike >25%: Increase normalization probability

## Continuous Improvement Backlog (Commit-Driven)
- Convert high-impact IRC appendices (RIM, ESG, Monte Carlo) into HTML modules for on-site browsing.
- Refresh scenario sensitivity tables in index.html and CATY_12_valuation_model.html with current 42.8 bps normalization assumptions.
- Automate reconciliation check between valuation_bridge_final.py outputs and README/index headline numbers (unit test or CI hook).
- Build dashboard for ESG KPIs (lending to underserved communities, board independence) sourced from CRA reports.
- Draft pre-earnings question bank for peers reporting before CATY to capture read-through signals.
