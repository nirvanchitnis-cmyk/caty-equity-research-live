## Post-Earnings Execution

**Timing:** October 21, 2025 (after market close)

**CRITICAL NOTE:** FDIC Q3 data will NOT be available until late November (~55 days after Sept 30). Use 10-Q reported NCO initially.

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Download Q3 2025 10-Q from SEC EDGAR
- Extract Q3 NCO rate from financials
- Note any CRE-related disclosures
- Capture management commentary on credit

### Step 2: FDIC Data Update
- Wait for FDIC Q3 2025 call report (typically 30-45 days after quarter-end)
- Expected availability: Mid-November 2025
- Download updated NTLNLSCOQR field
- Append to evidence/raw/fdic_CATY_NTLNLSCOQR_timeseries.csv

### Step 3: Probability Recalculation
**Script:** `python3 analysis/nco_probability_analysis.py`

**Actions:**
1. Update script with Q3 data point
2. Rerun Wilson 95% confidence intervals
3. Calculate new breach probabilities:
   - Post-2014 rate
   - Post-2008 rate
4. Update upper bound (currently 26%)

### Step 4: Valuation Refresh
**Script:** `python3 analysis/probability_weighted_valuation.py`

**Actions:**
1. Input new Wilson upper bound
2. Recalculate expected returns:
   - Data-anchored (85/15 or updated)
   - Wilson 95% upper (74/26 or updated)
3. Compare to +15% BUY threshold

### Step 5: Rating Decision
**Policy:** analysis/rating_policy.md

**Decision Tree:**
- If Wilson upper bound < 21.5% tail: **Entire band > +15% â†’ UPGRADE TO BUY**
- If Wilson upper bound 21.5-35% tail: **HOLD (current)**
- If Wilson upper bound > 35% tail: **Consider SELL**

**Auto-Flip Trigger:**
```
IF (1 - wilson_upper_bound) Ã— target_current + wilson_upper_bound Ã— target_normalized > current_price Ã— 1.15
THEN rating = BUY
```

### Step 6: Documentation
1. Update evidence/probability_dashboard.md with new numbers
2. Add SHA256 hash to evidence/README.md
3. Update DEREK_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md if rating changes
4. Update index.html rating badge if needed
5. **Run reconciliation guard:** `python3 analysis/reconciliation_guard.py`
   - Validates published numbers match script outputs
   - Must pass (exit code 0) before committing
   - If fails, fix discrepancies in README.md/index.html
6. **Regenerate site sections:** `python3 scripts/build_site.py`
   - Rebuilds valuation dashboard, module navigation, and evidence provenance table from JSON sources
   - Appends run status to `logs/automation_run.log`
7. **Execute disconfirmer monitor:** `python3 analysis/disconfirmer_monitor.py`
   - Exit code â‰  0 means a driver breached thresholdâ€”remediate and rerun before publishing
8. Git commit with timestamp
9. Push to GitHub

### Step 7: Notification
**If rating changes:**
- Update site immediately
- Document in commit message
- Notify Derek review desk

**If rating unchanged:**
- Update dashboard only
- Log in evidence/README.md

## Kill-Switches (Immediate Action)

**If Q3 shows:**
- NCO >35 bps: Run emergency stress test, consider SELL
- CET1 <10.5%: Review capital adequacy, adjust tail weight
- Classified loans spike >25%: Increase normalization probability
