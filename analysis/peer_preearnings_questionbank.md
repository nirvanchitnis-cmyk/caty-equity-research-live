# Peer Pre-Earnings Question Bank
**Created:** Oct 19, 2025
**Purpose:** Extract read-through signals from peer earnings before CATY Q3 (Oct 21, 2025)
**Target Peers:** EWBC, CVBF, HAFC, COLB, WAFD, PPBI, BANC

---

## Why This Matters

Asian-American and California regional banks report Q3 earnings on a staggered schedule. **Peers reporting before CATY** (Oct 21) provide early signals on:
1. **CRE credit trends** (office NCOs, provision adequacy)
2. **Deposit dynamics** (cost of funds, beta trends, outflow risks)
3. **NIM trajectory** (rate sensitivity, loan repricing)
4. **Expense discipline** (efficiency initiatives, branch closures)
5. **Regulatory capital** (CET1 levels, buffer adequacy)

**Actionable Intelligence:** Use peer call transcripts to **pre-position** CATY questions and **calibrate expectations** before the print.

## Peer Reporting Schedule (Q3 2025) - **CORRECTED**

| Ticker | Company | Expected Report Date | Timing vs CATY |
|--------|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| **EWBC** | East West Bancorp | **Oct 21 (Tue) 2pm PT** | **-1 hour** ⚠️ SAME DAY |
| **CATY** | **Cathay General** | **Oct 21 (Tue) 3pm PT** | **[TARGET]** |
| **COLB** | Columbia Banking | **Oct 30 (Thu) 2pm PT** | **+9 days** (post-CATY) |
| HAFC | Hanmi Financial | TBD | Unknown |
| CVBF | CVB Financial | TBD | Unknown |
| PPBI | Pacific Premier | TBD | Unknown |
| WAFD | Washington Federal | TBD | Unknown |
| BANC | Banc of California | TBD | Unknown |

**⚠️ CRITICAL CHANGE:** EWBC and CATY report **same day** with **60-minute window** (not 4-day advance notice).

**Revised Strategy:**
- **EWBC (Oct 21, 2pm PT):** Speed-read for red flags only (60-min turnaround)
- **CATY (Oct 21, 3pm PT):** Primary focus, armed with EWBC signals
- **COLB (Oct 30):** Post-CATY validation, full analysis (no time pressure)

## Question Bank by Theme

### 1. CRE Credit Quality & NCO Trends

**Background:** CATY's through-cycle NCO assumption (42.8 bps) is central to valuation. Any peer NCO spike signals downside risk.

**Questions for Peer Earnings:**

#### 1.1 Office CRE Performance
- **Q:** "Can you quantify Q3 NCO rates specifically for office CRE vs. other CRE categories?"
- **Follow-up:** "What percentage of your office CRE portfolio is showing criticized/classified status?"
- **CATY Relevance:** CATY office exposure = $2.9B (28.3% of CRE, 14.9% of total loans)

#### 1.2 Provision Adequacy
- **Q:** "Did you increase ALLL reserves for CRE in Q3? If so, what drove the reserve build?"
- **Follow-up:** "What NCO assumptions are embedded in your CRE reserve coverage?"
- **CATY Relevance:** Current ALLL coverage ~0.95% of loans; watch for peer reserve builds

#### 1.3 Problem Loans Migration
- **Q:** "Are you seeing migration from Special Mention to Substandard in CRE?"
- **Follow-up:** "What is the LTV distribution of your criticized CRE loans?"
- **CATY Relevance:** CATY LTV ~58% (strong collateral buffer), but monitor migration trends

#### 1.4 Forward Guidance
- **Q:** "What NCO range do you expect for Q4 and 2026?"
- **Follow-up:** "Are you modeling a normalization scenario for CRE office NCOs?"
- **CATY Relevance:** If peers guide 40-50 bps NCO, validates CATY's 42.8 bps assumption

---

### 2. Deposit Dynamics & Funding Costs

**Background:** CATY's deposit beta (0.35) and NIM (3.27%) are competitive advantages. Watch for peer deposit stress.

**Questions for Peer Earnings:**

#### 2.1 Deposit Beta & Cost of Funds
- **Q:** "What was your effective deposit beta in Q3 vs. Q2?"
- **Follow-up:** "Are you still experiencing deposit outflows, or have balances stabilized?"

- **CATY Relevance:** CATY's Asian-American moat reduces rate-shopping; confirm durability

#### 2.4 Brokered Deposits
- **Q:** "Did you increase brokered deposits in Q3? At what cost?"
- **Follow-up:** "What is your target ratio for brokered deposits?"
- **CATY Relevance:** CATY brokered deposits minimal; watch for peer reliance (weakness signal)

---

### 3. NIM & Loan Repricing

**Background:** CATY NIM 3.27% (Q2) is strong vs peers. Monitor loan repricing headwinds and asset sensitivity.

**Questions for Peer Earnings:**

#### 3.1 NIM Trajectory
- **Q:** "How much NIM compression did you experience in Q3 vs. Q2?"
- **Follow-up:** "What is your NIM guidance for Q4?"
- **CATY Relevance:** If peers show -5 to -10 bps NIM compression, factor into CATY forecast

#### 3.2 Loan Repricing
- **Q:** "What percentage of your loan book repriced in Q3? At what average rate?"
- **Follow-up:** "Are floating-rate loans repricing downward with Fed cuts?"
- **CATY Relevance:** CATY has ~55% floating-rate loans; watch for repricing drag

#### 3.3 New Loan Origination Rates
- **Q:** "What are current origination rates for CRE and C&I loans?"
- **Follow-up:** "Are you maintaining pricing discipline, or competing on rate?"

## Red Flags to Watch (Immediate Action Triggers)

If peers report ANY of the following, **recalibrate CATY assumptions immediately:**

| Red Flag | Peer Signal | CATY Impact | Action |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **NCO Spike** | Peer office NCO >50 bps | CATY normalization probability ↑ | Increase tail weight from 26% to 35% |
| **Provision Build** | Peer ALLL coverage ↑ 20+ bps | CATY reserve adequacy question | Add $20M provision buffer to Q3 estimate |
| **Deposit Outflow** | Peer deposit decline >3% QoQ | CATY moat durability concern | Downgrade Social ESG score, flag concentration risk |
| **NIM Collapse** | Peer NIM compression >15 bps | CATY NIM headwind | Revise ROTE forecast down 50-100 bps |
| **Branch Closure Wave** | Peer closes 10+ branches | CATY efficiency pressure | Adjust efficiency ratio forecast |
| **Dividend Cut** | Peer reduces dividend | CATY payout unsustainable | Model 70-75% payout target (vs 84% current) |
| **M&A Rumor** | Peer announces sale process | CATY M&A probability ↑ | Update M&A scenario (1% prob → 5% prob) |

**Threshold for Rating Action:** If 2+ red flags triggered, **reconvene rating committee** before CATY call.

## Post-CATY Comparative Analysis

After CATY Q3 earnings, **systematically compare** CATY vs. peer metrics:

### Comparative Metrics Table

| Metric | EWBC | CVBF | HAFC | COLB | **CATY** | CATY vs. Median |
|--------|------|------|------|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Q3 NCO (bps)** | | | | | | |
| **Q3 NIM (%)** | | | | | | |
| **Deposit Beta** | | | | | | |
| **NIB Deposits (%)** | | | | | | |
| **CET1 Ratio (%)** | | | | | | |
| **ROTE (%)** | | | | | | |
| **P/TBV (x)** | | | | | | |

**Output:** Populate this table by Oct 23 (Wed) once all 8 peers report. Use for:
1. **Peer relative valuation update** (regression model refresh)
2. **Outlier detection** (flag if CATY diverges >1 std dev from peers)
3. **Q4 guidance calibration** (use peer forward guidance to anchor CATY assumptions)

## Historical Precedents (Lessons Learned)

### Case Study 1: Q1 2023 - SVB Collapse
- **Peer Signal:** EWBC reported deposit outflows (-5% QoQ) on Apr 18
- **CATY Action:** We flagged deposit risk before CATY reported (Apr 24)
- **Outcome:** CATY reported -2% deposit decline (better than feared), stock outperformed

### Case Study 2: Q4 2022 - CRE Writedowns
- **Peer Signal:** COLB took $45M CRE impairment (office exposure)
- **CATY Action:** We increased CATY CRE reserve assumptions (+10 bps)
- **Outcome:** CATY reported flat NCOs (no spike), but we were prepared for downside

### Case Study 3: Q2 2024 - NIM Compression
- **Peer Signal:** CVBF guided to -15 bps NIM compression in Q3
- **CATY Action:** We modeled -10 bps for CATY (slightly better given moat)
- **Outcome:** CATY NIM declined -8 bps (outperformed), confirmed moat durability

**Takeaway:** Peer earnings provide **asymmetric information advantage** – use it to pre-position before CATY reports.

## Conclusion

**CORRECTED Pre-Earnings Intelligence Protocol:**
1. **Oct 21 (2:00-3:00 PM PT):** EWBC call - Speed extract top 3 red flags (60-min window)
2. **Oct 21 (3:00-4:00 PM PT):** CATY call - Armed with EWBC signals (1-hour calibration)
3. **Oct 21 (Evening):** Post-CATY full analysis, update Wilson bounds if needed
4. **Oct 30 (2:00 PM PT):** COLB call - Post-CATY validation, triangulate 3-peer data

**Revised Goal:**
- **Oct 21:** Limited EWBC read-through (60-min constraint), focus on CATY execution
