## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The CATY equity research codebase has been thoroughly audited and prepared for Q3 2025 earnings execution on October 21, 2025. All critical rating inconsistencies have been resolved, Python scripts validated, and evidence infrastructure confirmed ready.

**KEY TIMELINE UPDATE:** Q3 earnings are October 21 (NOT Oct 28 as in original handoff docs). FDIC NCO data will lag until late November (~55 days after Sept 30).

---

## CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED (Commit b1c7426)

### 1. README.md Scenario Table - CUSTOMER-FACING FIX
**Issue:** Scenario table showed conflicting "SELL" ratings despite HOLD thesis
**Fixed:** Lines 58-66
- Removed "Rating" column with SELL labels
- Added probability-weighted expected return explanation below table
- Clarified: 74% × $56.42 + 26% × $40.32 = **$51.97 (+13.3%) → HOLD**

### 2. evidence/README.md Title
**Issue:** Line 3 said "SELL Thesis" (outdated)
**Fixed:** Changed to "Equity Research - HOLD Rating (Wilson 95% Framework)"

### 3. Handoff Document Date Corrections
**Files Updated:**
- `/Users/nirvanchitnis/Desktop/Handoffs to CLI for Q3/CLAUDE_CLI_Q3_HANDOFF.md`
- `/Users/nirvanchitnis/Desktop/Handoffs to CLI for Q3/DEREK_CODEX_Q3_HANDOFF.md`

**Changes:**
- Oct 28 → Oct 21, 2025 (5 instances)
- Added FDIC data lag warning (available late November)
- Fixed repository URL typo (removed duplicate "live")

### 4. Repository Cleanup
**Removed:**
- Backup files: *.bak, README.md.final2
- Push scripts: push_*.sh, final_readme_push.sh
- Python cache: __pycache__ directories
- macOS artifacts: .DS_Store files

**Archived:**
- SESSION_HISTORY.md → evidence/archive/
- PREVENTION_MEASURES.md → evidence/archive/

**Added:**
- .gitignore (prevents future clutter)

## PRE-FLIGHT AUDIT RESULTS

### ✅ RATING CONSISTENCY SCAN (Subagent Review)
**Status:** PASSED with fixes applied

**Issues Found and Resolved:**
- README.md scenario table: SELL → removed ratings column, added weighted explanation ✅
- evidence/README.md: Title updated to HOLD ✅
- Handoff documents: Dates corrected ✅

**Wilson 95% Framework:** ALL references consistent (74/26 split)
- No instances of outdated 60/40 or 85/15 weights
- Expected return consistently +13.3%
- BUY trigger consistently <21.5% tail probability

### ✅ EVIDENCE TRAIL AUDIT (Subagent Review)
**Status:** READY with minor hash logging pending

**Verified:**
- ✅ FDIC NCO CSV structure (166 rows, 1984-2025Q2)
- ✅ Last row: 20250630, NCO=0.217322% (<45.8 bps threshold)
- ✅ Post-2014 breach rate: 0.0% (46 quarters)
- ✅ Wilson 95% upper bound: 7.7% → 26% tail in valuation model
- ✅ Primary source SHA256 hashes logged (10 10-Qs + 1 PDF)
- ✅ probability_dashboard.md current (Oct 19, 05:40 PT)

**Pending:**
- ⏳ SHA256 hash logging for generated outputs (README.md lines 409, 419)
- Action: Calculate hashes after Q3 update

### ✅ PYTHON SCRIPT VALIDATION (Manual Testing)
**Status:** READY - Both scripts execute correctly

**nco_probability_analysis.py:**
```bash
$ python3 analysis/nco_probability_analysis.py
# Outputs:
| Post-2014 | 46 | 0.0% | 7.7% |  # Wilson 95% upper bound
| Post-GFC (>= 2008) | 70 | 15.7% | 26.0% |
```
✅ Formula verified: z=1.96, threshold=0.00458, matches spec
✅ Output matches evidence/NCO_probability_summary.md

**probability_weighted_valuation.py:**
```bash
$ python3 analysis/probability_weighted_valuation.py
# Outputs:
Data-Anchored: P(Current)=85.0%, Target=$53.86, Return=+17.4%
95% Upper Bound: P(Current)=74.0%, Target=$51.97, Return=+13.3%
BUY hurdle: requires P(Current) >= 78.5% (tail <= 21.5%)
```
✅ Wilson 74/26 weighting correct
✅ Expected return +13.3% matches HOLD rating
✅ BUY trigger calculation correct

**Hardcoded Values (Update for Q3):**
- Line 9: `current_price = 45.87` → Update with Oct 21 closing price
- Line 7: `target_current = 56.42` (regression, keep unless peer multiples change)
- Line 8: `target_normalized = 39.32` (Gordon Growth, keep unless ROTE changes)

## Q3 EARNINGS EXECUTION CHECKLIST

### PHASE 1: DATA COLLECTION (Oct 21, 2025 after market close)

#### Step 1.1: Download 10-Q Filing
```bash
# Check SEC EDGAR for Q3 2025 10-Q
curl -sL -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (research@analysis.com)' \
  https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0000861842&type=10-Q&count=1 \
  -o /tmp/caty_latest_10q_index.html

# Find accession number, download full HTML filing
```

#### Step 1.2: Extract Q3 NCO Rate
**Search in 10-Q for:**
- "Net charge-offs"
- "NCO"
- "Allowance for Credit Losses"
- "Provision for credit losses"

**Extract:**
- Q3 2025 NCO rate (annualized bps) - typically in MD&A or Credit Quality note
- CRE portfolio updates (any office exposure changes?)
- Management commentary on credit outlook

**Expected Q3 Consensus (for comparison):**
- EPS: $1.17 (vs Q3'24 actual $0.94)
- Revenue: $202.71M
- Q3'24 actual NCO: ~7.2 bps (extrapolated from Q4'24 28.2 bps spike)

#### Step 1.3: Manual FDIC CSV Append (Late November)
**IMPORTANT:** FDIC data lags ~55 days. Initial Q3 analysis uses 10-Q NCO.

**When FDIC available (post-Nov 15):**
```bash
cd /Users/nirvanchitnis/Desktop/CATY_Clean
# Download updated FDIC data
curl -sL 'https://api.fdic.gov/banks/financials?filters=CERT:18503&fields=REPDTE,NTLNLSCOQR&sort_by=REPDTE&order=asc&limit=500&format=csv' \
  -o /tmp/fdic_CATY_NTLNLSCOQR_updated.csv

# Verify Q3 row present: REPDTE=20250930
# Append to evidence/raw/fdic_CATY_NTLNLSCOQR_timeseries.csv
```

**Format:** `18503_20250930,<NCO_VALUE>,20250930`

---

### PHASE 2: PROBABILITY RECALCULATION

#### Step 2.1: Update nco_probability_analysis.py Input
```bash
cd /Users/nirvanchitnis/Desktop/CATY_Clean
# CSV should now have 167 rows (1984-Q1 through 2025-Q3)
python3 analysis/nco_probability_analysis.py > /tmp/nco_q3_output.txt
```

**Expected Output:**
```
| Post-2014 | 47 | X.X% | Y.Y% |  # Wilson 95% upper bound
```

**Key Questions:**
1. Did Q3 NCO breach 45.8 bps threshold? (If yes, breach rate jumps from 0.0%)
2. What is new Wilson 95% upper bound? (Was 7.7%, will drop slightly if no breach)
3. Post-2014 sample size: 47 quarters (was 46)

#### Step 2.2: Extract Wilson Upper Bound
**From output above, note the Wilson 95% upper bound percentage.**

Example:
- If Q3 NCO = 22 bps (no breach): Upper bound drops to ~7.5%
- If Q3 NCO = 50 bps (BREACH!): Upper bound spikes dramatically

**This upper bound becomes the tail probability for valuation.**

---

### PHASE 3: VALUATION REFRESH

#### Step 3.1: Update probability_weighted_valuation.py
```bash
cd /Users/nirvanchitnis/Desktop/CATY_Clean
nano analysis/probability_weighted_valuation.py
```

**Update Line 9:**
```python
current_price = 47.50  # Example: Update with Oct 21 closing price
```

**Update Line 20 (if needed):**
```python
upper_prob_current = 0.74  # Update with NEW Wilson result (1 - upper_bound)
```

**Note:** If Wilson upper bound is 7.5%, then:
- Tail probability = 7.5% (very low)
- Base probability = 92.5% (very high)
- Expected return will be much higher than +13.3%
- Rating likely upgrades to BUY (> +15%)

#### Step 3.2: Run Valuation Script
```bash
python3 analysis/probability_weighted_valuation.py
```

**Interpret Output:**
```
95% Upper Bound: P(Current)=XX.X%, P(Normalized)=YY.Y%, Target=$ZZ.ZZ, Return=+AA.A%
BUY hurdle: requires P(Current) >= 78.5% (tail <= 21.5%)
```

**Decision Logic:**
- If return > +15%: **UPGRADE TO BUY**
- If return -10% to +15%: **HOLD MAINTAINED**
- If return < -10%: **DOWNGRADE TO SELL** (unlikely unless breach occurred)

---

### PHASE 4: RATING DECISION (Apply Auto-Flip Criteria)

**Auto-Flip Trigger:**
- IF Wilson upper bound < 21.5% (tail < 21.5%)
- THEN entire confidence interval clears +15% BUY threshold
- THEN **AUTOMATIC UPGRADE TO BUY**

**Manual Review Triggers (Flag for Derek):**
- Q3 NCO > 35 bps (2 consecutive quarters above threshold)
- CET1 < 10.5% (capital adequacy concern)
- Classified loans spike > 25% (leading indicator)
- Office CRE writedowns disclosed (validate tail scenario)

**Boundary Case:**
- If expected return = 14.8% to 15.2% (within 0.5% of threshold)
- Flag for Derek manual review before finalizing

---

### PHASE 5: DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

#### Step 5.1: Update probability_dashboard.md
```bash
nano evidence/probability_dashboard.md
```

**Update:**
- Last Updated: October 21, 2025, [TIME] PT
- Wilson 95% Upper Bound row: Update base/tail/expected return/rating
- BUY Trigger distance calculation
- Next Update: Q4 2025 (Jan 28, 2026)

#### Step 5.2: Update evidence/README.md Document Control Log
**Add rows:**
```
| 2025-10-21 | 1600 | Q3 10-Q NCO extract | [filename] | SHA256: [run shasum] | ARCHIVED |
| 2025-11-15 | 1200 | FDIC Q3 append | fdic_CATY_NTLNLSCOQR_timeseries.csv | SHA256: [run shasum] | UPDATED |
| 2025-11-15 | 1400 | Wilson recalc | NCO_probability_summary.md | SHA256: [run shasum] | UPDATED |
| 2025-11-15 | 1500 | Valuation update | probability_dashboard.md | SHA256: [run shasum] | UPDATED |
```

#### Step 5.3: Update Website (if rating changes)
**If rating changes from HOLD:**

**index.html:**
- Line ~120: Update rating badge
  - `<span class="rating-badge">HOLD</span>` → `<span class="rating-badge buy">BUY</span>`
- Line ~692: Update expected return
  - "+13.3% expected (Wilson 74/26)" → "+XX.X% expected (Wilson YY/ZZ)"

**CATY_12_valuation_model.html:**
- Update probability table with new Wilson bounds
- Update scenario cards if rating changed

**README.md:**
- Line 26: Update expected price and return
- Lines 64-66: Update probability-weighted calculation

codex attach evidence/probability_dashboard.md
codex attach evidence/NCO_probability_summary.md

codex prompt "Derek: Q3 update complete. Wilson upper bound moved from 26% to [XX]%. Expected return now [+XX.X%]. Rating [HOLD/BUY]. Please brutally review and validate auto-flip decision."
```

**Derek Will Validate:**
- Wilson bounds calculation correct
- Auto-flip logic executed correctly
- Evidence trail complete (SHA256 hashes)
- No kill-switches missed
- Rating decision matches policy

## KNOWN ISSUES & WORKAROUNDS

### Issue 1: FDIC Data Lag
**Problem:** FDIC Q3 data won't be available until late November (~55 days after Sept 30)

**Workaround:**
1. Use 10-Q reported NCO for initial analysis (Oct 21)
2. Document caveat: "FDIC call report pending, using management-reported NCO"
3. Rerun Wilson bounds when FDIC data available (mid-November)
4. If FDIC NCO differs materially from 10-Q, update analysis and re-publish

### Issue 2: Hardcoded Prices in valuation.py
**Problem:** `current_price = 45.87` hardcoded on line 9

**Workaround:**
1. Update manually before each earnings execution
2. Consider future enhancement: Read from CSV or API
3. For Q3: Update with Oct 21 closing price after market close

### Issue 3: Peer Regression Staleness
**Problem:** Peer multiples (EWBC, CVBF, HAFC) from Q2 2025 data

**Workaround:**
1. If Q3 peer earnings cause material P/TBV changes, recalibrate regression
2. Check EWBC, CVBF, HAFC Q3 reports (typically release same week as CATY)
3. If EWBC drops from 1.83x to 1.50x, target_current needs adjustment
4. Document in commit message if regression updated
