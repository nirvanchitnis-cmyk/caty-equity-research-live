## Executive Summary

CATY's CRE concentration (52.4%) is **24.6 percentage points ABOVE peer median (27.8%)**, positioning CATY as a HIGH-CRE outlier among its peer group.

## Quantitative Impact

**Excess CRE Exposure:** $4,867M (24.6% Ã— $19,785M total loans)

### Annual Incremental NCO Impact
- CRE NCO premium: 15 bps higher than non-CRE loans
- Incremental NCO: $7.3M/year  
- After-tax impact: $5.8M/year
- **CET1 burn: 3 bps/year**

### Reserve Build Requirement
- Target ACL on excess CRE (1.0%): $48.7M
- Current ACL: $41.0M
- **Incremental provision: $7.7M one-time**

### 3-Year Capital Erosion
- Cumulative NCO impact: $17.5M
- Provision build (after-tax): $6.2M
- **Total capital impact: $23.7M**
- **CET1 erosion: 12 bps**
- Pro forma CET1: 13.23% (vs current 13.35%)

## Thesis Implications

1. **Compounds NCO normalization thesis:** Through-cycle NCO of 42.8 bps PLUS 3 bps CRE premium = 45.8 bps effective NCO rate

2. **Capital constraint tightens:** 12 bps additional CET1 erosion reduces buyback capacity and dividend flexibility

3. **Valuation multiple compression:** Higher credit risk profile justifies lower P/TBV multiple vs peers

4. **Strengthens SELL thesis:** CRE outlier status increases downside vulnerability, supporting target price $40.32 (-12.1%)
