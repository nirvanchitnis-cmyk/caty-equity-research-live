<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Forward-Looking Statements and Additional Information In this presentation, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;East West&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to East West Bancorp, Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. Forward-Looking Statements This presentation contains forward-looking statements that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for such statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on the current assumptions, beliefs, estimates, and projections, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. You should not place undue reliance on these statements. There are various important factors that could cause the Company&#8217;s future results to differ materially from historical performance and any forward-looking statements, including the factors described in the Company&#8217;s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and in its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind these risks and uncertainties, as well as any cautionary statements the Company may make. These statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based only on information then actually known to the Company. The Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims, any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, except as required by law. Basis of Presentation The preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, income and expenses during the reporting periods, and the related disclosures. Although our estimates consider current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual results could be materially different from those estimates. Hence, the current period&#8217;s results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any future interim period or for the year as a whole. Certain prior period information have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Industry Information This presentation includes statistical and other industry and market data that we obtained from government reports and other third-party sources. Although we believe that this information is accurate and reliable, we have not independently verified such information. Forward-looking information that we have obtained from these sources is subject to the same uncertainties and qualifications as other forward-looking statements contained herein. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Certain financial information in this presentation has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP and is presented on a non-GAAP basis. Investors should refer to the reconciliations included in the appendix to this presentation and should consider the Company&#8217;s non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. 2 </FONT></DIV>

Non- GAAP measures used consist of FTE net interest income and total  revenue. The FTE adjustment relates to tax exempt interest on certain investment securities and loans. Adjusted total revenue and adjusted total revenue (FTE) reflect the adjustments related to the discount accretion  and interest recoveries from the full payment on purchased credit impaired and workout loans. Adjusted noninterest expense reflects the change in equity award expense recognition for retirement eligible employees,  and the FDIC special assessment and DC Solar adjustments (as applicable).
