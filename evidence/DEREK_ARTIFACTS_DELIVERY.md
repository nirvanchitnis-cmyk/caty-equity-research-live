- Document before/after delta

**Target Completion:** By 2100 PT today (per Derek's deadline)

### 6. PEER COMP SOURCING
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Required:** 8 peer accession IDs with TBVPS/ROTE page citations
**Target Completion:** By 1800 PT tomorrow

### 7. CAPM BETA CALCULATION

**Required:** 5-year weekly returns, regression vs S&P 500
**Target Completion:** By 1800 PT tomorrow

## üìä KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY

### Office Risk: SUBSTANTIALLY DE-RISKED
**Original (Purged) Estimate:** 20-30% of CRE = $2.1-3.1B
**Actual (Sourced):** 14.3% of CRE = $1.5B (-29% to -52% from estimate)
**CBD Exposure:** $49M (0.25% of total loans) - MINIMAL

**Implication:** Office is NOT a material thesis driver. Through-cycle NCO normalization is PRIMARY driver.

---

### NO "UNDISCLOSED 44% BUCKET"
**Error Acknowledged:** I incorrectly claimed $4.47B undisclosed industrial/other.
**Reality:** All property types accounted for (see reconciliation above).
**Industrial + Warehouse:** $1.9B (19% of CRE) - FULLY DISCLOSED
