<p>Balances sourced via FDIC Bank Data API (<code>/banks/financials</code>, parameters <code>CERT:18503</code> and <code>REPDTE:20250630</code>). FDIC output reported in $000s and converted to $ billions to align with management disclosures.</p>

<h3>Variance Commentary</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Construction (RCON1410):</strong> FDIC value adds $10M of 1-4 family construction (RCON1418 subset) that management parks with residential mortgages. Backing this out aligns with Cathay‚Äôs $0.30B disclosure within rounding tolerance (&lt;$20M).</li>
<li><strong>Nonfarm nonresidential (RCON1415):</strong> FDIC retains $0.25B of land/special-use/restaurant loans inside owner-occupied buckets. Management shifts these into ‚ÄúOther CRE‚Äù; after this reclass, balances match within 3%.</li>
<li><strong>Multifamily (RCON1417):</strong> Management bundles investor 1-4 family loans (RCON1418) with multifamily to present ‚ÄúResidential CRE.‚Äù Adding RCON1418 ($0.27B) narrows the gap to $0.76B, attributable to held-for-sale balances noted in Q2‚Äô25 10-Q Note 5.</li>
<li><strong>Total loans (RCON1400):</strong> FDIC gross loans exceed management total by $9M because Cathay‚Äôs 10-Q nets unearned income/premium amortisation. Variance &lt;0.05%.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Evidence Artifacts</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>evidence/raw/fdic_CATY_20250630_financials.json</code> ‚Äì stored FDIC API response (generated 2025-10-19 04:22 PT).</li>
<li><code>analysis/scripts/fetch_fdic_rc_c.py</code> ‚Äì reproducible Python snippet for API call (new file, see repo root).</li>
<li>SHA256 hashes to be logged in <code>evidence/README.md</code> after artifact creation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Remaining Actions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Record hashes and entry in <code>evidence/README.md</code> for the JSON extract and this memo update.</li>
<li>Feed FDIC balances into <code>capital_stress_2025Q2.xlsx</code> (CRE tab) and recompute peer medians.</li>
<li>Push refreshed HTML/valuation artifacts once workbook aligns with regulatory data.</li>
