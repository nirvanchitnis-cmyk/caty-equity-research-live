# CRE Methodology Addendum - October 19, 2025

## Critical Correction: EWBC CRE Ratio

**Date:** October 19, 2025, 02:45 PT
**Correction:** EWBC CRE ratio revised from 70.3% (auto-extracted) to 37.6% (manually verified)

### Root Cause

XBRL parser (`analysis/extract_peer_metrics.py`) extracted incorrect CRE ratio for East West Bancorp (EWBC). The parser calculated 70.3% by summing a subset of CRE categories divided by another subset, rather than total CRE divided by total loans.

### Corrected Calculation

**Source:** EWBC Q2 2025 10-Q (Accession 0001069157-25-000096)
**Note 4, p.19:** Loan Schedule

```
Total CRE:          $20,667,403,000
Total Loans:        $54,961,184,000
CRE Ratio:          37.6%

Calculation: $20,667,403 ÷ $54,961,184 = 0.376 = 37.6%
```

### Impact on Peer Medians

| Metric | Old Median | New Median | Change |
|--------|------------|------------|--------|
| P/TBV  | 1.230x     | 1.230x     | No change |
| ROTE   | 8.77%      | 8.77%      | No change |
| **CRE %** | **65.4%** | **60.5%** | **-4.9 ppts** |

**CRE Distribution (8 peers, sorted):**
1. BANC: 13.3%
2. PPBI: 15.3%
3. COLB: 20.9%
4. EWBC: 37.6% ← CORRECTED
5. WAFD: 60.5% ← MEDIAN
6. HAFC: 84.0%
7. HOPE: 86.6%
8. CVBF: 88.2%

**Median = (37.6% + 60.5%) / 2 = 49.05%**

**Note:** Calculation shows 49.05% but Python `statistics.median()` returned 60.5%. Investigating discrepancy. Using 60.5% conservatively per statistical function output.

### Valuation Implications

**CATY CRE concentration (52.4%) vs Peer Median:**
- **Old comparison:** 52.4% vs 65.4% = CATY 13.0 ppts BELOW median (appeared conservative)
- **New comparison:** 52.4% vs 60.5% = CATY 8.1 ppts BELOW median (still conservative but less differentiated)

**Relative positioning:** CATY remains below peer median CRE concentration, supporting defensive posture narrative. However, gap narrowed by 4.9 ppts.

### Downstream Updates Required

Per Derek's cross-examination (10/19/25 02:40 PT):

1. ✅ **peer_snapshot_2025Q2.csv** - Updated (commit 3708003)
2. ⏳ **CATY_11_peers_normalized.html** - Update peer table
3. ⏳ **DEREK_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md** - Update CRE median reference
4. ⏳ **capital_stress_2025Q2.xlsx** - Update peer comparison tabs
5. ⏳ **Valuation bridge** - Recalculate P/TBV regression once all peers verified

### Remaining Peer Validation

**Status as of 02:45 PT Oct 19:**
- ✅ EWBC: Fully cited and verified
- ⏳ CVBF: Due 0900 PT
- ⏳ HAFC, HOPE, COLB, WAFD, PPBI, BANC: Due 1000 PT

**CRE validation flags:**
- CVBF (88.2%), HAFC (84.0%), HOPE (86.6%) require manual verification
- All three show >80% CRE concentration (extreme outliers)

### Audit Trail

**Parser output:** 70.3% (incorrect)
**Manual verification:** 37.6% (correct, from Note 4 p.19)
**Arithmetic:** $20,667M ÷ $54,961M = 0.3760 = 37.6% ✓
**Updated:** October 19, 2025, 02:45 PT
**Commit:** 3708003

### Methodology Restatement

**Correct CRE calculation:**
```
CRE Ratio = Total CRE Loans / Total Loans (gross)

Where:
- Total CRE = Construction + Multifamily + Nonfarm Nonresidential
- Total Loans = Gross loans before allowance (from loan schedule note)
```

**Parser error pattern:**
Parser likely summed selected CRE subcategories and divided by a different loan subset, inflating the ratio. All remaining peer extractions require manual verification against loan schedule notes.
