# IR Data Request — CRE DSCR and Maturity

Owner: Nirvan Chitnis  
Requested: 2025-10-22  
Requested From: Cathay General Bancorp IR (ir@cathaybank.com)  
Response Due: 2025-10-25 (EOD PT)

Purpose: Obtain office and aggregate CRE refinancing risk metrics not disclosed in Q3'25 deck/press release to complete risk assessment and board-ready evidence.

Requested Fields

1) Maturity Ladder (Office CRE)
- Buckets: ≤12 months, 12–24 months, 24–36 months, 36–60 months, >60 months
- For each bucket: outstanding balance ($), % of office CRE, weighted average coupon, % interest-only

2) DSCR Distribution (Office CRE)
- Buckets: <1.0x, 1.0–1.25x, 1.25–1.5x, 1.5–2.0x, >2.0x
- Provide: % of office CRE by bucket; weighted average DSCR; definition used (NOI period, capex treatment)

3) Collateral/Lease Profile (Office CRE)
- % single-tenant vs multi-tenant; average remaining lease term (WALT)
- % Class A / B / C (by $)

4) Amortization Profile (Office CRE)
- % interest-only vs amortizing; weighted average amortization term

5) Geography (Office CRE)
- Top states/cities by outstanding balance ($) and %; any submarket concentrations >10%

6) Aggregates (CRE Total)
- Same maturity and DSCR breakouts for total CRE (if available)

Format & Confidentiality
- Format: CSV or PDF is fine; please include definitions/footnotes
- Public availability: Confirm if any item is public (deck/10‑Q) vs non-public

Rationale and Linkage
- These metrics drive refinancing/default risk and capital planning. They will be referenced in the “CRE Office Status” evidence page with explicit citations. Absent disclosure, we will document as a material gap and avoid “confirmed” status.

Thank you,
