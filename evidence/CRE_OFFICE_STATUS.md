| Retail | $2,529 | 48% | $2.1M | Q3'25 Slides 7–8 |
| Office | $1,470 | 47% | $2.3M | Q3'25 Slides 7–8, 10 |
| Warehouse | ~$1,344 | 46% | $2.8M | Q3'25 Slides 7–8 |
| Industrial | $694 | 47% | $3.4M | Q3'25 Slides 7–8 |

| Land | $69 | 46% | $2.7M | Q3'25 Slides 7–8 |
| Theater | $20 | 54% | $6.5M | Q3'25 Slides 7–8 |
| TOTAL CRE | ~$10,500 | 49% | — | Q3'25 Slides 7–8 |

Reconciliation: sum of category amounts ≈ $10,488M; ≈$12M difference vs $10.5B total reflects rounding/“approx” category disclosures in the deck.

Geographic mix (CRE): CA 46%, NY 35%, TX 5%, IL 3%, WA 2%, Other 9% (Q3'25 Slide 7; unchanged vs Q2).

Interest‑rate swaps on CRE: $626M notional (~3.1% of total loans) per Q3'25 Slide 5; Q2'25 cited $966M (~4.9%). Notional ≠ risk; MTM depends on rates, hedge designation, and maturities.

## CBD EXPOSURE

**Source:** Q2 2025 Financial Results Presentation, Slide 10 - "Office CRE Collateral Distribution"

| Location Type | $ Millions | % of Office CRE |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Urban** | $948 | 64.0% |
| **Suburban** | $484 | 32.7% |
| **Central Business District (CBD)** | **$48 (Q3)** | **3.3% (Q3)** |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,481** | **100.0%** |

**CBD Definition (per presentation):** Central Business/Financial Centers (mainly city downtowns)

**Assessment:** CBD exposure of ~$48–49M represents ~3.3% of office CRE, ~0.5% of total CRE, and ~0.24% of total loans (~$20.1B in Q3). Minimal exposure to high‑vacancy urban cores.

**Implication:** Minimal exposure to high-vacancy urban core office markets (Los Angeles CBD, New York City downtown, etc.)

## GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION (OFFICE)

## Q2 → Q3 RECONCILIATION (Key Metrics)

| Metric | Q2'25 | Q3'25 | Δ | Source |
|--------|-------|-------|---|--------|
| Total CRE balance | $10,363M | ~$10,500M | +$137M | Q2 Slide 8; Q3 Slides 7–8 |
| Office CRE balance | $1,480M | $1,470M | -$10M | Q2 Slide 10; Q3 Slide 10 |
| Office W.A. LTV | 46% | 47% | +1 pp | Q2 Slide 10; Q3 Slide 10 |
| Total CRE W.A. LTV | 49% | 49% | 0 pp | Q2 Slide 8; Q3 Slides 7–8 |
| CRE swaps notional | $966M | $626M | -$340M | Q2 Slide 5; Q3 Slide 5 |
| CRE / Risk‑Based Capital | ~281% | ~231% | -50 ppts | Q2/Q3 concentration charts |

Formula note (illustrative): CRE/RBC = Total CRE / Risk‑Based Capital. At Q3'25: ~10.5B / RBC ≈ 2.31 → RBC ≈ ~$4.5B (approx.). This is a supervisory indicator shown by the company, not a GAAP measure; use regulatory filings for precise capital.

Notes:
- Aggregates reflect rounding/“~” values in Q3 deck.
- CRE/RBC shown in company slides; see “Definitions” for ratio description.

## CHANGES VS Q2'25 AND PRIOR ESTIMATES

| Metric | Original Estimate (PURGED) | Actual (Sourced) | Variance |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------|----------|
| **Office % of CRE** | 20–30% (unsourced) | ~14% | -29% to -52% |
| **Office $ Amount** | $2.1–3.1B (unsourced) | $1.47–1.48B (Q3–Q2) | -29% to -52% |
| **CBD Exposure** | Not estimated | ~$48–49M (~0.5% of CRE) | Minimal |
| **Office LTV** | Not estimated | 47% (Q3; 46% in Q2) | Conservative |
| **CRE swaps notional** | n/a | $626M (Q3) vs $966M (Q2) | ↓ ~$340M |
| **CRE/RBC concentration** | n/a | ~231% (Q3) vs ~281% (Q2) | Improved |

**Conclusion:** Office tail risk is **SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER** than phantom 20-30% range would have implied.

## WHY THIS WASN'T IN 10‑Q

**Q2 2025 10-Q (Accession 0001437749-25-025772):**
- **CRE total confirmed:** $10,363M ✓
- **Property-type table:** NOT PRESENT
- **Disclosure:** Single-line CRE item in loan schedule

**Why presentation has more detail:**
- Earnings presentations (non-GAAP) often include operational metrics not required in SEC filings
- Regional banks (sub-$50B) frequently disclose property mix in investor materials vs 10-Q/10-K
- Cathay does NOT file earnings presentations as 8-K exhibits - hosted on IR website only

**Evidence Trail:**
1. ✅ Searched Q2'25 10-Q → CRE $10.4B confirmed, NO property breakdown
2. ✅ Searched 20 8-K filings → NO presentation PDFs attached
3. ✅ IR redirected to public URL → Q2'25 presentation obtained
4. ✅ Slide 8 & 10 → Complete property-type table extracted

## UPDATED THESIS IMPLICATIONS

### **Office Risk: DOWNGRADED FROM CORE DRIVER TO MONITORING ITEM**

**Original (Purged) Thesis:**
- Office 20-30% of CRE = $2.1-3.1B
- Potential tail risk if office sector deteriorates
- Used in stress scenarios for capital modeling

**Revised Thesis (Sourced Data):**
- Office 14% of CRE = $1.5B
- CBD exposure minimal ($49M, 3.3% of office)
- LTV 46% provides equity cushion
- **No longer material driver of SELL thesis**

**New Risk Focus:**
- **Total CRE concentration (52.4%)** remains elevated
- **Through-cycle NCO normalization (42.8 bps)** is PRIMARY thesis driver
- **Undisclosed risks:** NONE - all property types now accounted for

## REMAINING DATA GAPS

| Data Point | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **Office % of CRE** | ✅ CONFIRMED | 14.3% ($1,480M) |
| **CBD exposure** | ✅ CONFIRMED | 3.3% of office ($49M) |
| **Office LTV** | ✅ CONFIRMED | 46% weighted average |
| **Multifamily detail** | ✅ CONFIRMED | $3,528M (34% of CRE) |
| **Retail detail** | ✅ CONFIRMED | $2,509M (24% of CRE) |
| **Industrial/Warehouse** | ✅ CONFIRMED | $636M + $1,295M (19% of CRE) |
| **Hotel/Motel** | ✅ CONFIRMED | $368M (4% of CRE) |
| **Maturity schedule** | ⏳ NOT DISCLOSED | % maturing 2025-2027 unavailable |
| **DSCR by property type** | ⏳ NOT DISCLOSED | Debt service coverage not broken out |

**Assessment:** Property‑type composition is confirmed. However, **maturity schedule (by year) and DSCR (by property type) remain material data gaps** not disclosed in Q3/Q2 decks or 10‑Q. These metrics are critical for refinancing/default risk analysis; continue to seek via 10‑Q footnotes, IR, or call transcripts.

## EARNINGS TIE‑OUT (Q3'25) — Press Release

- Primary source (archived): `evidence/primary_sources/CATY_Q3_2025_PressRelease_20251021.pdf` (see evidence/README.md for SHA256; URL: https://www.cathaybank.com/CGB/pr-20251021)
- Net interest margin (NIM): 3.31% (up from 3.27% in Q2'25) — “Third Quarter Highlights” and “Net interest income” sections.
- Net interest income before provision: $189.6M (Q3'25) vs $181.2M (Q2'25) — “Net interest income” section.
- Provision for credit losses: $28.7M, including $9.1M for two movie theatre loans and $3.8M from a CECL model change — “Provision for credit losses”.
- Net charge‑offs: $15.6M in Q3'25 vs $12.7M in Q2'25 — charge‑offs/recoveries table.
- Non‑accrual loans: $165.6M (↓ from $174.2M in Q2'25) — “Asset quality”.
- Allowance for credit losses (total): $196.5M (0.98% of gross loans) = $186.6M (loans) + $9.9M (off‑BS commitments) — “Provision/ACL”.
- Loans: $20.10B; Deposits: $20.52B — “Balance sheet”.

Interpretation:
- $9.1M provision tied to two movie theatre loans links to the “Theater” sub‑category (deck shows $20M outstanding). Monitor severity assumptions there.
- Rising NIM with higher provision suggests improving spreads but elevated credit costs; reflect in EPS/capital sensitivities.

---

## DEFINITIONS & CALCULATION NOTES

- CRE / Risk‑Based Capital (CRE/RBC): As shown in company slides; ratio relates total CRE loans to regulatory risk‑based capital (Tier 1 + Tier 2). Thresholds indicated: 300% (supervisory), 400% (internal). Supervisory indicator, not a GAAP metric. Use regulatory filings for denominator detail.
- Weighted Average LTV: Company‑reported; implicitly portfolio‑weighted within each category.
- CBD: Central Business District (central downtown financial/business areas), per slide footnote.
- Swaps Notional: Gross notional of interest‑rate swaps associated with CRE loans; not a measure of mark‑to‑market exposure or duration profile.

**Status:** PRELIMINARY — Office exposure ~$1.47B (~14% of CRE). Office remains a monitoring item rather than a core driver. Next steps: obtain/estimate DSCR and maturity ladder by property type; refresh stress tests with Q3 composition and updated swaps level; integrate Q3 press release credit tables.
