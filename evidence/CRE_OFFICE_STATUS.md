## CBD EXPOSURE: MINIMAL

**Source:** Q2 2025 Financial Results Presentation, Slide 10 - "Office CRE Collateral Distribution"

| Location Type | $ Millions | % of Office CRE |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Urban** | $948 | 64.0% |
| **Suburban** | $484 | 32.7% |
| **Central Business District (CBD)** | **$49** | **3.3%** |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,481** | **100.0%** |

**CBD Definition (per presentation):** Central Business/Financial Centers (mainly city downtowns)

**Critical Assessment:** CBD exposure of $49M represents:
- 3.3% of total office CRE
- 0.5% of total CRE portfolio
- 0.25% of total loans ($19.8B)

**Implication:** Minimal exposure to high-vacancy urban core office markets (Los Angeles CBD, New York City downtown, etc.)

## COMPARISON TO ORIGINAL (PURGED) ESTIMATES

| Metric | Original Estimate (PURGED) | Actual (Sourced) | Variance |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------|----------|
| **Office % of CRE** | 20-30% (unsourced) | 14.3% | -29% to -52% |
| **Office $ Amount** | $2.1-3.1B (unsourced) | $1.5B | -29% to -52% |
| **CBD Exposure** | Not estimated | $49M (0.5% of CRE) | Minimal |
| **Office LTV** | Not estimated | 46% | Conservative |

**Conclusion:** Office tail risk is **SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER** than phantom 20-30% range would have implied.

## WHY THIS WASN'T IN 10-Q

**Q2 2025 10-Q (Accession 0001437749-25-025772):**
- **CRE total confirmed:** $10,363M ✓
- **Property-type table:** NOT PRESENT
- **Disclosure:** Single-line CRE item in loan schedule

**Why presentation has more detail:**
- Earnings presentations (non-GAAP) often include operational metrics not required in SEC filings
- Regional banks (sub-$50B) frequently disclose property mix in investor materials vs 10-Q/10-K
- Cathay does NOT file earnings presentations as 8-K exhibits - hosted on IR website only

**Evidence Trail:**
1. ✅ Searched Q2'25 10-Q → CRE $10.4B confirmed, NO property breakdown
2. ✅ Searched 20 8-K filings → NO presentation PDFs attached
3. ✅ IR redirected to public URL → Q2'25 presentation obtained
4. ✅ Slide 8 & 10 → Complete property-type table extracted

## UPDATED THESIS IMPLICATIONS

### **Office Risk: DOWNGRADED FROM CORE DRIVER TO MONITORING ITEM**

**Original (Purged) Thesis:**
- Office 20-30% of CRE = $2.1-3.1B
- Potential tail risk if office sector deteriorates
- Used in stress scenarios for capital modeling

**Revised Thesis (Sourced Data):**
- Office 14% of CRE = $1.5B
- CBD exposure minimal ($49M, 3.3% of office)
- LTV 46% provides equity cushion
- **No longer material driver of SELL thesis**

**New Risk Focus:**
- **Total CRE concentration (52.4%)** remains elevated
- **Through-cycle NCO normalization (42.8 bps)** is PRIMARY thesis driver
- **Undisclosed risks:** NONE - all property types now accounted for
