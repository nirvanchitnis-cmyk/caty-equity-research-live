# CATY EQUITY RESEARCH - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR DEREK
**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Analyst:** Nirvan Chitnis
**Reviewer:** Derek
**Status:** READY FOR BRUTAL REVIEW

---

## ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)

**HOLD Cathay General Bancorp (CATY) at $45.87**

**Thesis:** Dual-path valuation shows conflict: Regression at current earnings (ROTE 11.95%) implies $56.42 target (+23% upside), but through-cycle normalization implies $39.32 (-14% downside). Wilson 95% confidence bounds on NCO breach probability give 74/26 probability split → expected $51.97 (+13.3%), just below +15% BUY threshold.

**Edge:** HOLD validated by statistical uncertainty. 95% upper bound (26% tail probability) keeps expected return at +13.3%, below BUY hurdle. Market pricing (38/62 split) appears overly pessimistic vs FDIC data (0% post-2014 breach rate).

**Rating:** HOLD (supported by 74/26 Wilson ceiling). Upgrade to BUY if tail probability tightens below 21.5%.

## HOW TO DESTROY THIS THESIS (Disconfirming Tests)

### Test 1: NCO Mean Reversion Assumption
**Claim:** Through-cycle NCO is 42.8 bps (2008-2024 FDIC average)

**Disconfirm:**
- File 07 has full 17-year table (2008-2024)
- GFC peak: 305.9 bps (2009)
- Post-COVID avg: 9.3 bps (2020-2024)
- Net recoveries: -5.7 bps (2017-2019)
- **Your job:** Argue why 2020-2024 average (9 bps) is better anchor than 17-year (43 bps)
- **Evidence location:** CATY_07_loans_credit_quality.html, NCO table, lines 550-700

**Sensitivity:** 10 bps NCO change = 20 bps ROTE impact = 0.025x P/TBV = $0.90 price impact

### Test 2: Peer Regression Small Sample
**Claim:** n=4 regression (CATY, EWBC, CVBF, HAFC) with R²=0.9548 is robust

**Disconfirm:**
- We excluded 6 peers (HOPE, PFBC, PPBI, WAFD, COLB, BANC)
- n=7 regression collapsed: Adj R²=-0.077, p=0.484 (NOT significant)
- **Your job:** Demand we use n=7 or n=10, prove exclusions are cherry-picking
- **Evidence location:** CATY_11_peers_normalized.html, "Peer Expansion Diagnostics" section
- **Our defense:** COLB has Cook's D 4.030 (one-time gains), BANC has negative TCE, PPBI data error

### Test 3: P/TBV Mapping Assumes COE=9.587%
**Claim:** Implied COE from peers is 9.587%

**Disconfirm:**
- Formula: COE = (ROTE - g) / (P/TBV - 1) + g
- Based on 4 peer multiples (EWBC 1.83x, CVBF 1.73x, HAFC 0.93x, CATY 1.27x)
- **Your job:** Prove COE should be 10.5% or 8.5%, recalc targets
- **Evidence location:** CATY_11, implied COE table, lines 800-850
- **Sensitivity:** COE 10.5% → P/TBV 1.00x → Target $36.16 (-21%)

### Test 4: Growth Rate Assumption
**Claim:** g = 2.5% is appropriate

**Disconfirm:**
- TBVPS CAGR 2015-2024: 6.54%
- TBVPS CAGR 2019-2024: 9.57%
- Retention rate: 67.9%, ROTE × Retention = 8.1%
- **Your job:** Demand we use empirical 6.5% or 9.5% growth
- **Evidence location:** CATY_12_valuation_model.html, assumptions table
- **Our defense:** CAGRs inflated by buybacks (20.8M treasury shares) + rate tailwinds

### Test 5: CRE Tail Risk
**Claim:** Office CRE exposure creates tail risk under stress scenario

**Disconfirm:**
- Office CRE % is **NOT DISCLOSED** in Q2'25 10-Q (see evidence/CRE_OFFICE_STATUS.md)
- Cannot quantify exposure without primary source (IR, 8-K deck, or regulatory data)
- **Your job:** Prove office is immaterial (<10% of CRE) OR that stress scenario overstates severity
- **Evidence location:** CATY_08_cre_exposure.html (tail risk scenarios), but NOTE: office $ amounts are ESTIMATES pending validation
- **Impact:** If office % unavailable, must rely on total CRE stress not office-specific

## ACL RESERVE BRIDGE INSIGHTS (Q3'23 - Q2'25)

**Source:** evidence/acl_bridge_2023Q3-2025Q2_FINAL.csv

**Three critical findings:**

1. **Provision Spike Q3-Q4 2024**
   - Q3'24: $15.3M provision (3x normal $5M run-rate)
   - Q4'24: $15.3M provision (sustained elevation)
   - **Interpretation:** Management responded to credit deterioration, building reserves proactively

2. **Peak Charge-Offs Q4 2024**
   - Q4'24 Net CO: $17.2M (highest in 8 quarters)
   - Annualized: ~35 bps (vs. current LTM 18 bps)
   - **Implication:** Credit losses already spiking before through-cycle normalization

3. **Coverage Ratio Expansion**
   - Q3'23: 0.80% (ACL / Avg Loans)
   - Q2'25: 0.90% (+10 bps improvement)
   - Despite $50M cumulative NCOs, ACL grew $147.5M → $174.5M (+18%)

**Derek's takeaway:** Reserve build validates credit concerns. Management sees stress. Through-cycle 42.8 bps thesis is conservative, not alarmist.

## DRIVER MAP (Derek's Framework)

| # | Driver | IS/BS/CF | Causality | Data Avail | Forecast Leverage | Mgmt Control | Variability | Score | Color |
|---|--------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|-------|-------|
| **1** | **Credit Normalization** | IS (Provision) | 5 | 5 | 5 | 2 | 5 | **22/25** | 🔴 RED |
| **2** | **NIM Compression** | IS (NII) | 4 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 4 | **19/25** | 🟡 YELLOW |
| **3** | **CRE Concentration** | BS (Loans) | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | **14/25** | 🟡 YELLOW |
| **4** | **Deposit Beta** | IS (Int Exp) | 4 | 5 | 3 | 1 | 4 | **17/25** | 🟡 YELLOW |
| **5** | **Buyback Capacity** | BS (Capital) | 3 | 5 | 2 | 5 | 2 | **17/25** | 🟢 GREEN |

**Scoring (0-5):**
- Causality: How directly does this impact EPS/ROTE?
- Data Availability: Can we quantify it from SEC filings?
- Forecast Leverage: Does 10% change materially move PT?
- Management Control: Can they mitigate it?
- Variability: How much could it move in 12 months?

**Driver #1 Breakdown (Credit Normalization):**
- **Causality 5/5:** NCO directly hits provision → pretax income → NI → ROTE
- **Data 5/5:** 17 years FDIC data (2008-2024), every quarterly NCO disclosed
- **Forecast Leverage 5/5:** 10 bps NCO = 20 bps ROTE = 0.025x P/TBV = $0.90 PT
- **Mgmt Control 2/5:** They can't control macro credit cycle
- **Variability 5/5:** GFC saw 306 bps spike; current 18 bps could triple

**Where This Model Breaks:**
- If Fed cuts 200 bps in 2025 → soft landing → NCO stays 20 bps → Bull case wins
- If office CRE never stresses → tail risk evaporates
- If CATY grows NIB deposits to 25% → deposit beta drops → NIM holds

### Calculations (Show Your Work)
All formulas in: **CATY_12_valuation_model.html** with step-by-step breakdowns

**Base Case Target ($40.32):**
```
Step 1: Normalize provision to 42.8 bps NCO
  Delta = (42.8 - 18.13) bps = 24.67 bps
  Delta Provision = 24.67 / 10,000 × $19,449M = $47.98M
  Tax Effect = $47.98M × 0.80 = $38.38M
  Normalized NI = $294.67M - $38.38M = $256.29M

Step 2: Calculate normalized ROTE
  Normalized ROTE = $256.29M / $2,465.09M × 100 = 10.40%

Step 3: P/TBV mapping (Gordon Growth)
  P/TBV = (ROTE - g) / (COE - g)
  P/TBV = (10.40 - 2.5) / (9.587 - 2.5) = 7.90 / 7.087 = 1.115x

Step 4: Target price
  Target = P/TBV × TBVPS = 1.115 × $36.16 = $40.32
```

**Where to Attack:**
- Provision normalization tax rate (we use 20%, effective is 19.56%)
- COE derivation (peer-calibrated vs. CAPM)
- Growth rate (we use 2.5%, empirical TBVPS CAGR is 6.54%)
- TBVPS base (Q2'25 $36.16 vs. FY2024 $34.81)

## DEREK'S LIKELY QUESTIONS (Prepare Answers)

### 1. "Why 42.8 bps and not 25 bps like the Street?"
**Answer:** File 07 has full FDIC history. 17-year average is 42.8 bps. Includes GFC (306 bps peak). Post-COVID only is 9 bps, but that's 4 years vs. 17 years including full credit cycle. We show Bull case at 25 bps ($46.02 target) with 25% probability.

**Evidence:** CATY_07_loans_credit_quality.html, through-cycle table + valuation implications section

### 2. "Peer regression with n=4 is a joke. Where's my n=10?"
**Answer:** We tried n=7 and n=10. Regression collapsed (Adj R²=-0.077). COLB has one-time gains (ROTE 33.4%, outlier). WAFD structural discount (P/TBV 0.37x despite ROTE 14.2%). BANC negative TCE. PPBI data error (P/TBV 2959x). We documented all exclusions with Cook's Distance analysis.

**Evidence:** CATY_11_peers_normalized.html, "Peer Expansion Diagnostics" collapsible section (lines 1100-1250)

### 3. "Show me the deposit beta calculation. I want to see the SEC filing excerpts."
**Answer:** File 05 has full walkthrough. Q1'22: 10-Q accession 0001437749-22-011384, MD&A average balances table shows IB cost 0.33%. Q2'25: 10-Q accession 0001437749-25-025772, shows IB cost 3.35%. Fed Funds: 0.50% → 5.50% = 5.00 ppt change. Beta: 3.02 / 5.00 = 60.4%.

**Evidence:** CATY_05_nim_decomposition.html, lines 490-545 (IB-Only section) + 545-580 (All-In section)

### 4. "Why P/TBV mapping and not DCF?"
**Answer:** Banks are valued on P/TBV vs. ROTE, not DCF. Gordon Growth rearrangement: P/TBV = (ROTE - g) / (COE - g). We show regression validates this (R²=0.95, p=0.02). DCF requires explicit NII/provision/expense forecasts which we don't have (not a forecast shop).

**Evidence:** CATY_12_valuation_model.html, "P/TBV Mapping Framework" section

### 5. "Your COE of 9.587% is absurdly low. CAPM would give 11%."
**Answer:** We reverse-engineered COE from peer P/TBV multiples (implied COE method). EWBC: 10.09%, CVBF: 9.21%, HAFC: 9.11%, CATY: 9.95%. Mean: 9.587%. We show sensitivity table: COE 10.5% → P/TBV 1.00x → Target $36.16. COE 11.0% → P/TBV 0.94x → Target $34.01.

**Evidence:** CATY_11 implied COE table (lines 850-900) + CATY_12 sensitivity analysis (lines 1050-1150)

### 6. "Monte Carlo is garbage. What are your assumptions?"
**Answer:** 10,000 paths. NCO ~ Normal(42.8, 35) bps truncated [0, 85]. COE ~ Normal(9.587%, 0.5%). g ~ Normal(2.5%, 0.4%). ROTE = f(NCO) deterministic via provision normalization. Gordon Growth enforced: COE - g ≥ 1.0%. Results: Median $40.16, Mean $40.47, Pr(FV > $45.89) = 31.1%.

**Evidence:** CATY_12_valuation_model.html, "Monte Carlo Summary" section (lines 1200-1280)

### 7. "Why exclude HOPE and PFBC from peers?"
**Answer:**
- HOPE: ROTE -1.71% (loss-making), efficiency 110.9% (distressed), P/TBV 0.52x (structural discount)
- PFBC: No SEC filings available, brokered deposits 12.91% (2x CATY), efficiency 31.8% (data quality outlier)

**Evidence:** CATY_11_peers_normalized.html, "Excluded Peers" table (lines 680-730)

### 8. "How do I know your ROTE calculation is correct?"
**Answer:**
- Formula: Net Income / Average TCE × 100
- LTM NI: $294.67M (verified in File 02)
- Avg TCE: $2,465.09M (Q2'25 $2,507.7M + FY2024 $2,466.7M + Q2'24 $2,421.2M + FY2023 $2,465.0M) / 4
- ROTE: 294.67 / 2,465.09 × 100 = 11.95%
- All numbers traceable to SEC filings with accession numbers

**Evidence:** CATY_12, "Audit Helpers" section shows full ROTE calculation bridge

### 9. "Brokered deposits 5.62% - is that a red flag?"
**Answer:** MODERATE risk. Peer comparison: HAFC 1.09%, CVBF 1.95%, EWBC 4.20%, CATY 5.62%, PFBC 12.91% (outlier). CATY above median but below outlier. Source: FDIC Call Report Schedule RC-E, not SEC 10-Q (disclosed at cert level, not entity level).

**Evidence:** CATY_06_deposits_funding.html, brokered deposits peer table (lines 450-550)

### 10. "What's your confidence interval on the $40.32 target?"
**Answer:** Monte Carlo 5th-95th percentile: $26.06 to $56.36. Base case is 60th percentile. 69% probability stock is overvalued (FV < $45.89 spot). 31% probability upside scenario (benign credit continues, NCO stays 20-25 bps).

**Evidence:** CATY_12_valuation_model.html, Monte Carlo summary with full distribution stats

## WEAKEST HOLES (Where Derek Will Attack)

### Hole #1: Small Sample Regression (n=4)
**Derek will say:** "R²=0.95 with n=4 is meaningless. I can fit 3 points with R²=1.0. Where's my n=20?"

**Our defense:**
- We screened n=10, excluded 6 for data quality (documented in File 11)
- n=4 has p-value 0.023 (significant at 5% level)
- n=7 regression had Adj R²=-0.077 (worthless)
- We disclose limitation in File 11 and README

**How to strengthen:**
- Expand to regional banks (n=15-20) if we can get clean data
- Add robustness check: bootstrap regression with confidence intervals
- Show cross-validation: leave-one-out RMSE

### Hole #2: Growth Rate (2.5% vs. 6.5% empirical)
**Derek will say:** "TBVPS grew 6.5% CAGR 2015-2024. Why are you using 2.5%?"

**Our defense:**
- 6.5% inflated by buybacks (20.8M treasury shares purchased)
- 6.5% inflated by 2022-2024 rate environment (NIM expansion)
- Forward g should be sustainable organic rate
- Retention rate 67.9% × ROTE 11.95% = 8.1% organic, but we use 2.5% (conservative)

**How to strengthen:**
- Show pro forma TBVPS CAGR excluding buyback effect
- Decompose 6.5% into: retention + valuation multiple expansion
- Prove 2.5% is anchored to long-run nominal GDP growth

### Hole #3: Office CRE NOT_DISCLOSED
**Derek will say:** "You're estimating $2.5B office exposure. Show me the 10-Q disclosure."

**Our defense:**
- 10-Q does NOT disclose office breakdown
- We estimated 20-30% of $10.4B CRE based on industry norms
- We flagged as "NOT_DISCLOSED" in File 08
- We show Bear case with 20% loss = $500M (vs. $173M ACL) as TAIL RISK, not base case

**How to strengthen:**
- Call Investor Relations and ask for office CRE %
- Compare to peers: EWBC office disclosure, CVBF office disclosure
- Reduce reliance on this driver for base case (currently it's Bear case only)

## VALUATION GUT CHECKS & SENSITIVITIES

### Gut Check 1: Is 1.115x P/TBV Reasonable?
**Peer Median:** 1.30x (EWBC 1.83x, CVBF 1.73x, HAFC 0.93x)
**CATY Current:** 1.269x
**CATY Fair (Normalized):** 1.115x

**Sanity:** CATY trades at premium to HAFC (0.93x) but discount to EWBC/CVBF. Normalized multiple of 1.115x implies CATY should trade between HAFC and CVBF, which makes sense given ROTE 10.40% is between HAFC 8.65% and CVBF 14.10%.

### Gut Check 2: Is -12% Downside Material?
**$40.32 vs. $45.89 = -$5.57 = -12.1%**

**Context:**
- Historical 52-week range: $34.80 - $52.10 (not provided, but illustrative)
- Median stock volatility: ~20% annualized
- -12% is within 1-year noise, but:
  - 60% probability base case
  - 15% probability -24% downside (Bear)
  - Risk/reward asymmetric: 69% prob downside vs. 31% prob upside

### Sensitivity Table: P/TBV to ROTE
**From CATY_12, regression slope 0.1244:**

| ROTE | Implied P/TBV | × TBVPS $36.16 | Target | vs Spot |
|------|---------------|----------------|--------|---------|
| 9.0% | 0.967x | $35.0 | -23.8% | STRONG SELL |
| 10.0% | 1.092x | $39.5 | -13.9% | SELL |
| **10.40%** | **1.115x** | **$40.32** | **-12.1%** | **SELL (BASE)** |
| 11.0% | 1.217x | $44.0 | -4.1% | HOLD |
| 11.95% | 1.335x | $48.3 | +5.2% | HOLD |
| 12.0% | 1.341x | $48.5 | +5.7% | BUY |

**Takeaway:** We need ROTE to stay above 11.5% to justify current price. Provision normalization drops ROTE to 10.4%. Hence SELL.

### Sensitivity Table: Target Price to NCO Assumption
**From CATY_12, provision normalization table:**

| NCO (bps) | Scenario | Normalized ROTE | P/TBV | Target | vs Spot | Scenario Return |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|-------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| 20 | Optimistic | 11.84% | 1.317x | $47.61 | +3.8% | Above HOLD |
| **25** | **Bull** | **11.52%** | **1.273x** | **$46.02** | **+0.3%** | **HOLD band** |
| 30 | Moderate | 11.20% | 1.228x | $44.39 | -3.3% | HOLD band |
| **42.8** | **Base** | **10.40%** | **1.115x** | **$40.32** | **-12.1%** | **Below HOLD** |
| 60 | Bear | 9.31% | 0.961x | $34.75 | -24.3% | Bear downside |

**Takeaway:** Target is highly sensitive to NCO assumption. 10 bps NCO = ~$0.90 price impact.
**Final Rating:** HOLD at $51.97 (+13.3%), calculated as Wilson 95% weighted average (74% × $56.42 + 26% × $39.32).

## RETHINK & RESUBMIT (Derek's Non-Negotiables)

If Derek approves, no action needed. If Derek demands changes:

### Task 1: Expand Peer Set to n=10
**File to update:** CATY_11_peers_normalized.html
**Python script:** `/Users/nirvanchitnis/Desktop/Agents_Terminal_Core/EWBC_readout/tmp/scripts/compute_caty_ltm_and_update_peers.py`
**Steps:**
1. Add PPBI, WAFD, COLB, BANC, OPBK, BNPK back to peer set
2. Re-run regression
3. Show before/after: n=4 (R²=0.95) vs. n=10 (R²=?)
4. If R² collapses, prove outliers are valid exclusions with residual plots

### Task 2: Use 25 bps NCO for Base Case (Street Consensus)
**Files to update:** CATY_12_valuation_model.html, index.html
**Changes:**
1. Swap Bull (25 bps) to Base case
2. Demote current Base (42.8 bps) to Bear case
3. Update probabilities: Bull 15%, Base 60%, Bear 25%
4. New target: $46.02 → HOLD rating (not SELL)

### Task 3: Prove 42.8 bps is Right Answer
**Action items:**
1. Get management guidance on expected NCO from Q2'25 earnings call transcript
2. Compare CATY's 42.8 bps to peer through-cycle NCOs (EWBC, CVBF, HAFC)
3. Show CATY has similar CRE mix to peers who experienced higher NCOs
4. Stress test: What if we exclude GFC (2009-2010)? Recompute average.

### Task 4: Add CAPM COE Calculation
**File to update:** CATY_11_peers_normalized.html
**Add section:**
1. Risk-free rate: 10-year UST 4.5% (as of Oct 2025)
2. Equity risk premium: 6.0% (historical)
3. Beta: Estimate from 5-year CATY vs. S&P 500 regression
4. CAPM COE = Rf + β × ERP
5. Compare to implied COE 9.587%
6. Reconcile difference or adjust valuation

## TESTING PROTOCOL FOR DEREK

### Full Review Workflow (15 minutes)
1. **Open website** (2 min): Click URL, verify it loads, check for 404 errors
2. **Test navigation** (3 min): Click all 12 cards, verify they open, click Back buttons
3. **Validate File 07** (3 min): Check NCO table has 17 years, verify 42.8 bps average
4. **Validate File 12** (4 min): Check scenarios (Bull/Base/Bear), verify $40.32 in Base, check Monte Carlo
5. **Validate File 11** (2 min): Check regression R²=0.9548, verify peer exclusions documented
6. **Cross-check** (1 min): Open 3 random files, verify TBVPS $36.16 consistent

### Spot Checks (5 minutes)
1. **TBVPS:** File 03 calculation = $2,507.7M / 69.343M = $36.16 ✓
2. **IB Beta:** File 05 calculation = (3.35 - 0.33) / 5.00 = 0.604 ✓
3. **NCO Rate:** File 07 calculation = (12.741M / 19,489.4M) × 10,000 = 6.54 bps ✓
4. **Target:** File 12 calculation = 1.115 × $36.16 = $40.32 ✓
5. **Regression:** File 11 slope = 0.1244, intercept = -0.1483, R² = 0.9548 ✓

### Disconfirming Tests (10 minutes)
1. **NCO Sensitivity:** Change 42.8 bps to 25 bps → Target becomes $46.02 (not $40.32)
2. **COE Sensitivity:** Change 9.587% to 10.5% → P/TBV becomes 1.10x → Target $39.78
3. **Growth Sensitivity:** Change 2.5% to 3.5% → P/TBV becomes 1.14x → Target $41.22
4. **TBVPS Sensitivity:** Use FY2024 $34.81 instead of Q2'25 $36.16 → Target $38.82
5. **Regression Fit:** CATY residual -0.069x means market already pricing 5% discount

**Conclusion from tests:** Model is sensitive to NCO and COE assumptions. Base case depends on accepting 42.8 bps through-cycle average.
